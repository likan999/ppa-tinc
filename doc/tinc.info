1 Introduction
**************

Tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunneling and
encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the
Internet.

   Because the tunnel appears to the IP level network code as a normal
network device, there is no need to adapt any existing software.  The
encrypted tunnels allows VPN sites to share information with each other
over the Internet without exposing any information to others.

   This document is the manual for tinc.  Included are chapters on how
to configure your computer to use tinc, as well as the configuration
process of tinc itself.

1.1 Virtual Private Networks
============================

A Virtual Private Network or VPN is a network that can only be accessed
by a few elected computers that participate.  This goal is achievable in
more than just one way.

   Private networks can consist of a single stand-alone Ethernet LAN.
Or even two computers hooked up using a null-modem cable.  In these
cases, it is obvious that the network is _private_, no one can access
it from the outside.  But if your computers are linked to the Internet,
the network is not private anymore, unless one uses firewalls to block
all private traffic.  But then, there is no way to send private data to
trusted computers on the other end of the Internet.

   This problem can be solved by using _virtual_ networks.  Virtual
networks can live on top of other networks, but they use encapsulation
to keep using their private address space so they do not interfere with
the Internet.  Mostly, virtual networks appear like a single LAN, even
though they can span the entire world.  But virtual networks can't be
secured by using firewalls, because the traffic that flows through it
has to go through the Internet, where other people can look at it.

   As is the case with either type of VPN, anybody could eavesdrop.  Or
worse, alter data.  Hence it's probably advisable to encrypt the data
that flows over the network.

   When one introduces encryption, we can form a true VPN.  Other
people may see encrypted traffic, but if they don't know how to
decipher it (they need to know the key for that), they cannot read the
information that flows through the VPN.  This is what tinc was made for.

1.2 tinc
========

I really don't quite remember what got us started, but it must have been
Guus' idea.  He wrote a simple implementation (about 50 lines of C) that
used the ethertap device that Linux knows of since somewhere about
kernel 2.1.60.  It didn't work immediately and he improved it a bit.
At this stage, the project was still simply called "vpnd".

   Since then, a lot has changed--to say the least.

   Tinc now supports encryption, it consists of a single daemon (tincd)
for both the receiving and sending end, it has become largely
runtime-configurable--in short, it has become a full-fledged
professional package.

   Tinc also allows more than two sites to connect to eachother and
form a single VPN.  Traditionally VPNs are created by making tunnels,
which only have two endpoints.  Larger VPNs with more sites are created
by adding more tunnels.  Tinc takes another approach: only endpoints
are specified, the software itself will take care of creating the
tunnels.  This allows for easier configuration and improved scalability.

   A lot can--and will be--changed. We have a number of things that we
would like to see in the future releases of tinc.  Not everything will
be available in the near future.  Our first objective is to make tinc
work perfectly as it stands, and then add more advanced features.

   Meanwhile, we're always open-minded towards new ideas.  And we're
available too.

1.3 Supported platforms
=======================

Tinc has been verified to work under Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD,
MacOS/X (Darwin), Solaris, and Windows (both natively and in a Cygwin
environment), with various hardware architectures.  These are some of
the platforms that are supported by the universal tun/tap device driver
or other virtual network device drivers.  Without such a driver, tinc
will most likely compile and run, but it will not be able to send or
receive data packets.

   For an up to date list of supported platforms, please check the list
on our website: `http://www.tinc-vpn.org/platforms/'.

File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of Linux kernels,  Next: Configuration of FreeBSD kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.1 Configuration of Linux kernels
------------------------------------

For tinc to work, you need a kernel that supports the Universal tun/tap
device.  Most distributions come with kernels that already support this.
Here are the options you have to turn on when configuring a new kernel:

     Code maturity level options
     [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
     Network device support
     <M> Universal tun/tap device driver support

   It's not necessary to compile this driver as a module, even if you
are going to run more than one instance of tinc.

   If you decide to build the tun/tap driver as a kernel module, add
these lines to `/etc/modules.conf':

     alias char-major-10-200 tun


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of FreeBSD kernels,  Next: Configuration of OpenBSD kernels,  Prev: Configuration of Linux kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.2 Configuration of FreeBSD kernels
--------------------------------------

For FreeBSD version 4.1 and higher, tun and tap drivers are included in
the default kernel configuration.  The tap driver can be loaded with
`kldload if_tap', or by adding `if_tap_load="YES"' to
`/boot/loader.conf'.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of OpenBSD kernels,  Next: Configuration of NetBSD kernels,  Prev: Configuration of FreeBSD kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.3 Configuration of OpenBSD kernels
--------------------------------------

For OpenBSD version 2.9 and higher, the tun driver is included in the
default kernel configuration.  There is also a kernel patch from
`http://diehard.n-r-g.com/stuff/openbsd/' which adds a tap device to
OpenBSD which should work with tinc, but with recent versions of
OpenBSD, a tun device can act as a tap device by setting the link0
option with ifconfig.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of NetBSD kernels,  Next: Configuration of Solaris kernels,  Prev: Configuration of OpenBSD kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.4 Configuration of NetBSD kernels
-------------------------------------

For NetBSD version 1.5.2 and higher, the tun driver is included in the
default kernel configuration.

   Tunneling IPv6 may not work on NetBSD's tun device.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of Solaris kernels,  Next: Configuration of Darwin (MacOS/X) kernels,  Prev: Configuration of NetBSD kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.5 Configuration of Solaris kernels
--------------------------------------

For Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8) and higher, the tun driver may or may not be
included in the default kernel configuration.  If it isn't, the source
can be downloaded from `http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/'.  For x86 and
sparc64 architectures, precompiled versions can be found at
`http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/fragroute/'.  If the `net/if_tun.h'
header file is missing, install it from the source package.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of Darwin (MacOS/X) kernels,  Next: Configuration of Windows,  Prev: Configuration of Solaris kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.6 Configuration of Darwin (MacOS/X) kernels
-----------------------------------------------

Tinc on Darwin relies on a tunnel driver for its data acquisition from
the kernel.  Tinc supports either the driver from
`http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/', which supports both tun and tap
style devices, and also the driver from from
`http://chrisp.de/en/projects/tunnel.html'.  The former driver is
recommended.  The tunnel driver must be loaded before starting tinc
with the following command:

     kmodload tunnel


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration of Windows,  Prev: Configuration of Darwin (MacOS/X) kernels,  Up: Configuring the kernel

2.1.7 Configuration of Windows
------------------------------

You will need to install the latest TAP-Win32 driver from OpenVPN.  You
can download it from `http://openvpn.sourceforge.net'.  Using the
Network Connections control panel, configure the TAP-Win32 network
interface in the same way as you would do from the tinc-up script, as
explained in the rest of the documentation.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Libraries,  Prev: Configuring the kernel,  Up: Preparations

2.2 Libraries
=============

Before you can configure or build tinc, you need to have the OpenSSL,
zlib and lzo libraries installed on your system.  If you try to
configure tinc without having them installed, configure will give you
an error message, and stop.

* Menu:

* OpenSSL::
* zlib::
* lzo::


File: tinc.info,  Node: OpenSSL,  Next: zlib,  Up: Libraries

2.2.1 OpenSSL
-------------

For all cryptography-related functions, tinc uses the functions provided
by the OpenSSL library.

   If this library is not installed, you wil get an error when
configuring tinc for build.  Support for running tinc with other
cryptographic libraries installed _may_ be added in the future.

   You can use your operating system's package manager to install this
if available.  Make sure you install the development AND runtime
versions of this package.

   If you have to install OpenSSL manually, you can get the source code
from `http://www.openssl.org/'.  Instructions on how to configure,
build and install this package are included within the package.  Please
make sure you build development and runtime libraries (which is the
default).

   If you installed the OpenSSL libraries from source, it may be
necessary to let configure know where they are, by passing configure
one of the -with-openssl-* parameters.

     --with-openssl=DIR      OpenSSL library and headers prefix
     --with-openssl-include=DIR OpenSSL headers directory
                             (Default is OPENSSL_DIR/include)
     --with-openssl-lib=DIR  OpenSSL library directory
                             (Default is OPENSSL_DIR/lib)

License
.......

The complete source code of tinc is covered by the GNU GPL version 2.
Since the license under which OpenSSL is distributed is not directly
compatible with the terms of the GNU GPL
`http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html#LEGAL2', we include an
exemption to the GPL (see also the file COPYING.README) to allow
everyone to create a statically or dynamically linked executable:

     This program is released under the GPL with the additional
     exemption that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is
     allowed.  You may provide binary packages linked to the OpenSSL
     libraries, provided that all other requirements of the GPL are met.

   Since the LZO library used by tinc is also covered by the GPL, we
also present the following exemption:

     Hereby I grant a special exception to the tinc VPN project
     (http://www.tinc-vpn.org/) to link the LZO library with the
     OpenSSL library (http://www.openssl.org).

File: tinc.info,  Node: zlib,  Next: lzo,  Prev: OpenSSL,  Up: Libraries

2.2.2 zlib
----------

For the optional compression of UDP packets, tinc uses the functions
provided by the zlib library.

   If this library is not installed, you wil get an error when running
the configure script.  You can either install the zlib library, or
disable support for zlib compression by using the "-disable-zlib"
option when running the configure script. Note that if you disable
support for zlib, the resulting binary will not work correctly on VPNs
where zlib compression is used.

   You can use your operating system's package manager to install this
if available.  Make sure you install the development AND runtime
versions of this package.

   If you have to install zlib manually, you can get the source code
from `http://www.gzip.org/zlib/'.  Instructions on how to configure,
build and install this package are included within the package.  Please
make sure you build development and runtime libraries (which is the
default).


File: tinc.info,  Node: lzo,  Prev: zlib,  Up: Libraries

2.2.3 lzo
---------

Another form of compression is offered using the LZO library.

   If this library is not installed, you wil get an error when running
the configure script.  You can either install the LZO library, or
disable support for LZO compression by using the "-disable-lzo" option
when running the configure script. Note that if you disable support for
LZO, the resulting binary will not work correctly on VPNs where LZO
compression is used.

   You can use your operating system's package manager to install this
if available.  Make sure you install the development AND runtime
versions of this package.

   If you have to install lzo manually, you can get the source code
from `http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/'.  Instructions on how
to configure, build and install this package are included within the
package.  Please make sure you build development and runtime libraries
(which is the default).

3 Installation
**************

If you use Debian, you may want to install one of the precompiled
packages for your system.  These packages are equipped with system
startup scripts and sample configurations.

   If you cannot use one of the precompiled packages, or you want to
compile tinc for yourself, you can use the source.  The source is
distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Download the
source from the download page (http://www.tinc-vpn.org/download/),
which has the checksums of these files listed; you may wish to check
these with md5sum before continuing.

   Tinc comes in a convenient autoconf/automake package, which you can
just treat the same as any other package.  Which is just untar it, type
`./configure' and then `make'.  More detailed instructions are in the
file `INSTALL', which is included in the source distribution.

File: tinc.info,  Node: Building and installing tinc,  Next: System files,  Up: Installation

3.1 Building and installing tinc
================================

Detailed instructions on configuring the source, building tinc and
installing tinc can be found in the file called `INSTALL'.

   If you happen to have a binary package for tinc for your
distribution, you can use the package management tools of that
distribution to install tinc.  The documentation that comes along with
your distribution will tell you how to do that.

* Menu:

* Darwin (MacOS/X) build environment::
* Cygwin (Windows) build environment::
* MinGW (Windows) build environment::


File: tinc.info,  Node: Darwin (MacOS/X) build environment,  Next: Cygwin (Windows) build environment,  Up: Building and installing tinc

3.1.1 Darwin (MacOS/X) build environment
----------------------------------------

In order to build tinc on Darwin, you need to install the MacOS/X
Developer Tools from
`http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html' and a recent
version of Fink from `http://www.finkproject.org/'.

   After installation use fink to download and install the following
packages: autoconf25, automake, dlcompat, m4, openssl, zlib and lzo.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Cygwin (Windows) build environment,  Next: MinGW (Windows) build environment,  Prev: Darwin (MacOS/X) build environment,  Up: Building and installing tinc

3.1.2 Cygwin (Windows) build environment
----------------------------------------

If Cygwin hasn't already been installed, install it directly from
`http://www.cygwin.com/'.

   When tinc is compiled in a Cygwin environment, it can only be run in
this environment, but all programs, including those started outside the
Cygwin environment, will be able to use the VPN.  It will also support
all features.


File: tinc.info,  Node: MinGW (Windows) build environment,  Prev: Cygwin (Windows) build environment,  Up: Building and installing tinc

3.1.3 MinGW (Windows) build environment
---------------------------------------

You will need to install the MinGW environment from
`http://www.mingw.org'.

   When tinc is compiled using MinGW it runs natively under Windows, it
is not necessary to keep MinGW installed.

   When detaching, tinc will install itself as a service, which will be
restarted automatically after reboots.


File: tinc.info,  Node: System files,  Prev: Building and installing tinc,  Up: Installation

3.2 System files
================

Before you can run tinc, you must make sure you have all the needed
files on your system.

* Menu:

* Device files::
* Other files::


File: tinc.info,  Node: Device files,  Next: Other files,  Up: System files

3.2.1 Device files
------------------

Most operating systems nowadays come with the necessary device files by
default, or they have a mechanism to create them on demand.

   If you use Linux and do not have udev installed, you may need to
create the following device file if it does not exist:

     mknod -m 600 /dev/net/tun c 10 200


File: tinc.info,  Node: Other files,  Prev: Device files,  Up: System files

3.2.2 Other files
-----------------

`/etc/networks'
...............

You may add a line to `/etc/networks' so that your VPN will get a
symbolic name.  For example:

     myvpn 10.0.0.0

`/etc/services'
...............

You may add this line to `/etc/services'.  The effect is that you may
supply a `tinc' as a valid port number to some programs.  The number
655 is registered with the IANA.

     tinc            655/tcp    TINC
     tinc            655/udp    TINC

4.1 Configuration introduction
==============================

Before actually starting to configure tinc and editing files, make sure
you have read this entire section so you know what to expect.  Then,
make it clear to yourself how you want to organize your VPN: What are
the nodes (computers running tinc)?  What IP addresses/subnets do they
have?  What is the network mask of the entire VPN?  Do you need special
firewall rules?  Do you have to set up masquerading or forwarding rules?
Do you want to run tinc in router mode or switch mode?  These questions
can only be answered by yourself, you will not find the answers in this
documentation.  Make sure you have an adequate understanding of
networks in general.  A good resource on networking is the Linux
Network Administrators Guide (http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag2/).

   If you have everything clearly pictured in your mind, proceed in the
following order: First, generate the configuration files (`tinc.conf',
your host configuration file, `tinc-up' and perhaps `tinc-down').  Then
generate the keypairs.  Finally, distribute the host configuration
files.  These steps are described in the subsections below.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Multiple networks,  Next: How connections work,  Prev: Configuration introduction,  Up: Configuration

4.2 Multiple networks
=====================

In order to allow you to run more than one tinc daemon on one computer,
for instance if your computer is part of more than one VPN, you can
assign a NETNAME to your VPN.  It is not required if you only run one
tinc daemon, it doesn't even have to be the same on all the sites of
your VPN, but it is recommended that you choose one anyway.

   We will asume you use a netname throughout this document.  This
means that you call tincd with the -n argument, which will assign a
netname to this daemon.

   The effect of this is that the daemon will set its configuration
root to `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/', where NETNAME is your argument to the -n
option.  You'll notice that it appears in syslog as `tinc.NETNAME'.

   However, it is not strictly necessary that you call tinc with the -n
option.  In this case, the network name would just be empty, and it will
be used as such.  tinc now looks for files in `/etc/tinc/', instead of
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/'; the configuration file should be
`/etc/tinc/tinc.conf', and the host configuration files are now
expected to be in `/etc/tinc/hosts/'.

   But it is highly recommended that you use this feature of tinc,
because it will be so much clearer whom your daemon talks to.  Hence,
we will assume that you use it.


File: tinc.info,  Node: How connections work,  Next: Configuration files,  Prev: Multiple networks,  Up: Configuration

4.3 How connections work
========================

When tinc starts up, it parses the command-line options and then reads
in the configuration file tinc.conf.  If it sees one or more
`ConnectTo' values pointing to other tinc daemons in that file, it will
try to connect to those other daemons.  Whether this succeeds or not
and whether `ConnectTo' is specified or not, tinc will listen for
incoming connection from other deamons.  If you did specify a
`ConnectTo' value and the other side is not responding, tinc will keep
retrying.  This means that once started, tinc will stay running until
you tell it to stop, and failures to connect to other tinc daemons will
not stop your tinc daemon for trying again later.  This means you don't
have to intervene if there are temporary network problems.

   There is no real distinction between a server and a client in tinc.
If you wish, you can view a tinc daemon without a `ConnectTo' value as
a server, and one which does specify such a value as a client.  It does
not matter if two tinc daemons have a `ConnectTo' value pointing to
each other however.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Configuration files,  Next: Generating keypairs,  Prev: How connections work,  Up: Configuration

4.4 Configuration files
=======================

The actual configuration of the daemon is done in the file
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf' and at least one other file in the
directory `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/'.

   These file consists of comments (lines started with a #) or
assignments in the form of

     Variable = Value.

   The variable names are case insensitive, and any spaces, tabs,
newlines and carriage returns are ignored.  Note: it is not required
that you put in the `=' sign, but doing so improves readability.  If
you leave it out, remember to replace it with at least one space
character.

   The server configuration is complemented with host specific
configuration (see the next section). Although all host configuration
options for the local node listed in this document can also be put in
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf', it is recommended to put host specific
configuration options in the host configuration file, as this makes it
easy to exchange with other nodes.

   In this section all valid variables are listed in alphabetical order.
The default value is given between parentheses, other comments are
between square brackets.

File: tinc.info,  Node: Main configuration variables,  Next: Host configuration variables,  Up: Configuration files

4.4.1 Main configuration variables
----------------------------------

AddressFamily = <ipv4|ipv6|any> (any)
     This option affects the address family of listening and outgoing
     sockets.  If any is selected, then depending on the operating
     system both IPv4 and IPv6 or just IPv6 listening sockets will be
     created.

BindToAddress = <ADDRESS> [<PORT>] [experimental]
     If your computer has more than one IPv4 or IPv6 address, tinc will
     by default listen on all of them for incoming connections.
     Multiple BindToAddress variables may be specified, in which case
     listening sockets for each specified address are made.

     If no PORT is specified, the socket will be bound to the port
     specified by the Port option, or to port 655 if neither is given.
     To only bind to a specific port but not to a specific address, use
     "*" for the ADDRESS.

     This option may not work on all platforms.

BindToInterface = <INTERFACE> [experimental]
     If you have more than one network interface in your computer, tinc
     will by default listen on all of them for incoming connections.
     It is possible to bind tinc to a single interface like eth0 or
     ppp0 with this variable.

     This option may not work on all platforms.

Broadcast = <no | mst | direct> (mst) [experimental]
     This option selects the way broadcast packets are sent to other
     daemons.  _NOTE: all nodes in a VPN must use the same Broadcast
     mode, otherwise routing loops can form._

    no
          Broadcast packets are never sent to other nodes.

    mst
          Broadcast packets are sent and forwarded via the VPN's
          Minimum Spanning Tree.  This ensures broadcast packets reach
          all nodes.

    direct
          Broadcast packets are sent directly to all nodes that can be
          reached directly.  Broadcast packets received from other
          nodes are never forwarded.  If the IndirectData option is
          also set, broadcast packets will only be sent to nodes which
          we have a meta connection to.

ConnectTo = <NAME>
     Specifies which other tinc daemon to connect to on startup.
     Multiple ConnectTo variables may be specified, in which case
     outgoing connections to each specified tinc daemon are made.  The
     names should be known to this tinc daemon (i.e., there should be a
     host configuration file for the name on the ConnectTo line).

     If you don't specify a host with ConnectTo, tinc won't try to
     connect to other daemons at all, and will instead just listen for
     incoming connections.

DecrementTTL = <yes | no> (no) [experimental]
     When enabled, tinc will decrement the Time To Live field in IPv4
     packets, or the Hop Limit field in IPv6 packets, before forwarding
     a received packet to the virtual network device or to another node,
     and will drop packets that have a TTL value of zero, in which case
     it will send an ICMP Time Exceeded packet back.

     Do not use this option if you use switch mode and want to use IPv6.

Device = <DEVICE> (`/dev/tap0', `/dev/net/tun' or other depending on platform)
     The virtual network device to use.  Tinc will automatically detect
     what kind of device it is.  Note that you can only use one device
     per daemon.  Under Windows, use INTERFACE instead of DEVICE.  Note
     that you can only use one device per daemon.  See also *note
     Device files::.

DeviceType = <TYPE> (platform dependent)
     The type of the virtual network device.  Tinc will normally
     automatically select the right type of tun/tap interface, and this
     option should not be used.  However, this option can be used to
     select one of the special interface types, if support for them is
     compiled in.

    dummy
          Use a dummy interface.  No packets are ever read or written
          to a virtual network device.  Useful for testing, or when
          setting up a node that only forwards packets for other nodes.

    raw_socket
          Open a raw socket, and bind it to a pre-existing INTERFACE
          (eth0 by default).  All packets are read from this interface.
          Packets received for the local node are written to the raw
          socket.  However, at least on Linux, the operating system
          does not process IP packets destined for the local host.

    multicast
          Open a multicast UDP socket and bind it to the address and
          port (separated by spaces) and optionally a TTL value
          specified using DEVICE.  Packets are read from and written to
          this multicast socket.  This can be used to connect to UML,
          QEMU or KVM instances listening on the same multicast address.
          Do NOT connect multiple tinc daemons to the same multicast
          address, this will very likely cause routing loops.  Also
          note that this can cause decrypted VPN packets to be sent out
          on a real network if misconfigured.

    uml (not compiled in by default)
          Create a UNIX socket with the filename specified by DEVICE,
          or `/var/run/NETNAME.umlsocket' if not specified.  Tinc will
          wait for a User Mode Linux instance to connect to this socket.

    vde (not compiled in by default)
          Uses the libvdeplug library to connect to a Virtual
          Distributed Ethernet switch, using the UNIX socket specified
          by DEVICE, or `/var/run/vde.ctl' if not specified.

     Also, in case tinc does not seem to correctly interpret packets
     received from the virtual network device, it can be used to change
     the way packets are interpreted:

    tun (BSD and Linux)
          Set type to tun.  Depending on the platform, this can either
          be with or without an address family header (see below).

    tunnohead (BSD)
          Set type to tun without an address family header.  Tinc will
          expect packets read from the virtual network device to start
          with an IP header.  On some platforms IPv6 packets cannot be
          read from or written to the device in this mode.

    tunifhead (BSD)
          Set type to tun with an address family header.  Tinc will
          expect packets read from the virtual network device to start
          with a four byte header containing the address family,
          followed by an IP header.  This mode should support both IPv4
          and IPv6 packets.

    tap (BSD and Linux)
          Set type to tap.  Tinc will expect packets read from the
          virtual network device to start with an Ethernet header.

DirectOnly = <yes|no> (no) [experimental]
     When this option is enabled, packets that cannot be sent directly
     to the destination node, but which would have to be forwarded by
     an intermediate node, are dropped instead.  When combined with the
     IndirectData option, packets for nodes for which we do not have a
     meta connection with are also dropped.

Forwarding = <off|internal|kernel> (internal) [experimental]
     This option selects the way indirect packets are forwarded.

    off
          Incoming packets that are not meant for the local node, but
          which should be forwarded to another node, are dropped.

    internal
          Incoming packets that are meant for another node are
          forwarded by tinc internally.

          This is the default mode, and unless you really know you need
          another forwarding mode, don't change it.

    kernel
          Incoming packets are always sent to the TUN/TAP device, even
          if the packets are not for the local node.  This is less
          efficient, but allows the kernel to apply its routing and
          firewall rules on them, and can also help debugging.

GraphDumpFile = <FILENAME> [experimental]
     If this option is present, tinc will dump the current network
     graph to the file FILENAME every minute, unless there were no
     changes to the graph.  The file is in a format that can be read by
     graphviz tools.  If FILENAME starts with a pipe symbol |, then the
     rest of the filename is interpreted as a shell command that is
     executed, the graph is then sent to stdin.

Hostnames = <yes|no> (no)
     This option selects whether IP addresses (both real and on the VPN)
     should be resolved.  Since DNS lookups are blocking, it might
     affect tinc's efficiency, even stopping the daemon for a few
     seconds everytime it does a lookup if your DNS server is not
     responding.

     This does not affect resolving hostnames to IP addresses from the
     configuration file, but whether hostnames should be resolved while
     logging.

Interface = <INTERFACE>
     Defines the name of the interface corresponding to the virtual
     network device.  Depending on the operating system and the type of
     device this may or may not actually set the name of the interface.
     Under Windows, this variable is used to select which network
     interface will be used.  If you specified a Device, this variable
     is almost always already correctly set.

LocalDiscovery = <yes | no> (no) [experimental]
     When enabled, tinc will try to detect peers that are on the same
     local network.  This will allow direct communication using LAN
     addresses, even if both peers are behind a NAT and they only
     ConnectTo a third node outside the NAT, which normally would
     prevent the peers from learning each other's LAN address.

     Currently, local discovery is implemented by sending broadcast
     packets to the LAN during path MTU discovery.  This feature may
     not work in all possible situations.

Mode = <router|switch|hub> (router)
     This option selects the way packets are routed to other daemons.

    router
          In this mode Subnet variables in the host configuration files
          will be used to form a routing table.  Only unicast packets
          of routable protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) are supported in this
          mode.

          This is the default mode, and unless you really know you need
          another mode, don't change it.

    switch
          In this mode the MAC addresses of the packets on the VPN will
          be used to dynamically create a routing table just like an
          Ethernet switch does.  Unicast, multicast and broadcast
          packets of every protocol that runs over Ethernet are
          supported in this mode at the cost of frequent broadcast ARP
          requests and routing table updates.

          This mode is primarily useful if you want to bridge Ethernet
          segments.

    hub
          This mode is almost the same as the switch mode, but instead
          every packet will be broadcast to the other daemons while no
          routing table is managed.

KeyExpire = <SECONDS> (3600)
     This option controls the time the encryption keys used to encrypt
     the data are valid.  It is common practice to change keys at
     regular intervals to make it even harder for crackers, even though
     it is thought to be nearly impossible to crack a single key.

MACExpire = <SECONDS> (600)
     This option controls the amount of time MAC addresses are kept
     before they are removed.  This only has effect when Mode is set to
     "switch".

Name = <NAME> [required]
     This is a symbolic name for this connection.  The name should
     consist only of alfanumeric and underscore characters (a-z, A-Z,
     0-9 and _).

     If Name starts with a $, then the contents of the environment
     variable that follows will be used.  In that case, invalid
     characters will be converted to underscores.  If Name is $HOST,
     but no such environment variable exist, the hostname will be read
     using the gethostnname() system call.

PingInterval = <SECONDS> (60)
     The number of seconds of inactivity that tinc will wait before
     sending a probe to the other end.

PingTimeout = <SECONDS> (5)
     The number of seconds to wait for a response to pings or to allow
     meta connections to block. If the other end doesn't respond within
     this time, the connection is terminated, and the others will be
     notified of this.

PriorityInheritance = <yes|no> (no) [experimental]
     When this option is enabled the value of the TOS field of tunneled
     IPv4 packets will be inherited by the UDP packets that are sent
     out.

PrivateKey = <KEY> [obsolete]
     This is the RSA private key for tinc. However, for safety reasons
     it is advised to store private keys of any kind in separate files.
     This prevents accidental eavesdropping if you are editting the
     configuration file.

PrivateKeyFile = <PATH> (`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/rsa_key.priv')
     This is the full path name of the RSA private key file that was
     generated by `tincd --generate-keys'.  It must be a full path, not
     a relative directory.

ProcessPriority = <low|normal|high>
     When this option is used the priority of the tincd process will be
     adjusted.  Increasing the priority may help to reduce latency and
     packet loss on the VPN.

Proxy = socks4 | socks4 | http | exec ... [experimental]
     Use a proxy when making outgoing connections.  The following proxy
     types are currently supported:

    socks4 <ADDRESS> <PORT> [<USERNAME>]
          Connects to the proxy using the SOCKS version 4 protocol.
          Optionally, a USERNAME can be supplied which will be passed
          on to the proxy server.

    socks4 <ADDRESS> <PORT> [<USERNAME> <PASSWORD>]
          Connect to the proxy using the SOCKS version 5 protocol.  If
          a USERNAME and PASSWORD are given, basic username/password
          authentication will be used, otherwise no authentication will
          be used.

    http <ADDRESS> <PORT>
          Connects to the proxy and sends a HTTP CONNECT request.

    exec <COMMAND>
          Executes the given command which should set up the outgoing
          connection.  The environment variables `NAME', `NODE',
          `REMOTEADDRES' and `REMOTEPORT' are available.

ReplayWindow = <bytes> (16)
     This is the size of the replay tracking window for each remote
     node, in bytes.  The window is a bitfield which tracks 1 packet
     per bit, so for example the default setting of 16 will track up to
     128 packets in the window. In high bandwidth scenarios, setting
     this to a higher value can reduce packet loss from the interaction
     of replay tracking with underlying real packet loss and/or
     reordering. Setting this to zero will disable replay tracking
     completely and pass all traffic, but leaves tinc vulnerable to
     replay-based attacks on your traffic.

StrictSubnets <yes|no> (no) [experimental]
     When this option is enabled tinc will only use Subnet statements
     which are present in the host config files in the local
     `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/' directory.

TunnelServer = <yes|no> (no) [experimental]
     When this option is enabled tinc will no longer forward
     information between other tinc daemons, and will only allow
     connections with nodes for which host config files are present in
     the local `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/' directory.  Setting this
     options also implicitly sets StrictSubnets.

UDPRcvBuf = <bytes> (OS default)
     Sets the socket receive buffer size for the UDP socket, in bytes.
     If unset, the default buffer size will be used by the operating
     system.

UDPSndBuf = <bytes> Pq OS default
     Sets the socket send buffer size for the UDP socket, in bytes.  If
     unset, the default buffer size will be used by the operating
     system.



File: tinc.info,  Node: Host configuration variables,  Next: Scripts,  Prev: Main configuration variables,  Up: Configuration files

4.4.2 Host configuration variables
----------------------------------

Address = <IP ADDRESS|HOSTNAME> [<port>] [recommended]
     This variable is only required if you want to connect to this
     host.  It must resolve to the external IP address where the host
     can be reached, not the one that is internal to the VPN.  If no
     port is specified, the default Port is used.

Cipher = <CIPHER> (blowfish)
     The symmetric cipher algorithm used to encrypt UDP packets.  Any
     cipher supported by OpenSSL is recognized.  Furthermore,
     specifying "none" will turn off packet encryption.  It is best to
     use only those ciphers which support CBC mode.

ClampMSS = <yes|no> (yes)
     This option specifies whether tinc should clamp the maximum
     segment size (MSS) of TCP packets to the path MTU. This helps in
     situations where ICMP Fragmentation Needed or Packet too Big
     messages are dropped by firewalls.

Compression = <LEVEL> (0)
     This option sets the level of compression used for UDP packets.
     Possible values are 0 (off), 1 (fast zlib) and any integer up to 9
     (best zlib), 10 (fast lzo) and 11 (best lzo).

Digest = <DIGEST> (sha1)
     The digest algorithm used to authenticate UDP packets.  Any digest
     supported by OpenSSL is recognized.  Furthermore, specifying
     "none" will turn off packet authentication.

IndirectData = <yes|no> (no)
     This option specifies whether other tinc daemons besides the one
     you specified with ConnectTo can make a direct connection to you.
     This is especially useful if you are behind a firewall and it is
     impossible to make a connection from the outside to your tinc
     daemon.  Otherwise, it is best to leave this option out or set it
     to no.

MACLength = <BYTES> (4)
     The length of the message authentication code used to authenticate
     UDP packets.  Can be anything from 0 up to the length of the
     digest produced by the digest algorithm.

PMTU = <MTU> (1514)
     This option controls the initial path MTU to this node.

PMTUDiscovery = <yes|no> (yes)
     When this option is enabled, tinc will try to discover the path
     MTU to this node.  After the path MTU has been discovered, it will
     be enforced on the VPN.

Port = <PORT> (655)
     This is the port this tinc daemon listens on.  You can use decimal
     portnumbers or symbolic names (as listed in `/etc/services').

PublicKey = <KEY> [obsolete]
     This is the RSA public key for this host.

PublicKeyFile = <PATH> [obsolete]
     This is the full path name of the RSA public key file that was
     generated by `tincd --generate-keys'.  It must be a full path, not
     a relative directory.

     From version 1.0pre4 on tinc will store the public key directly
     into the host configuration file in PEM format, the above two
     options then are not necessary. Either the PEM format is used, or
     exactly *one of the above two options* must be specified in each
     host configuration file, if you want to be able to establish a
     connection with that host.

Subnet = <ADDRESS[/PREFIXLENGTH[#WEIGHT]]>
     The subnet which this tinc daemon will serve.  Tinc tries to look
     up which other daemon it should send a packet to by searching the
     appropiate subnet.  If the packet matches a subnet, it will be
     sent to the daemon who has this subnet in his host configuration
     file.  Multiple subnet lines can be specified for each daemon.

     Subnets can either be single MAC, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, in which
     case a subnet consisting of only that single address is assumed,
     or they can be a IPv4 or IPv6 network address with a prefixlength.
     For example, IPv4 subnets must be in a form like 192.168.1.0/24,
     where 192.168.1.0 is the network address and 24 is the number of
     bits set in the netmask.  Note that subnets like 192.168.1.1/24
     are invalid!  Read a networking HOWTO/FAQ/guide if you don't
     understand this.  IPv6 subnets are notated like fec0:0:0:1::/64.
     MAC addresses are notated like 0:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e.

     Prefixlength is the number of bits set to 1 in the netmask part;
     for example: netmask 255.255.255.0 would become /24, 255.255.252.0
     becomes /22. This conforms to standard CIDR notation as described
     in RFC1519 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1519.txt)

     A Subnet can be given a weight to indicate its priority over
     identical Subnets owned by different nodes. The default weight is
     10. Lower values indicate higher priority. Packets will be sent to
     the node with the highest priority, unless that node is not
     reachable, in which case the node with the next highest priority
     will be tried, and so on.

TCPonly = <yes|no> (no) [deprecated]
     If this variable is set to yes, then the packets are tunnelled
     over a TCP connection instead of a UDP connection.  This is
     especially useful for those who want to run a tinc daemon from
     behind a masquerading firewall, or if UDP packet routing is
     disabled somehow.  Setting this options also implicitly sets
     IndirectData.

     Since version 1.0.10, tinc will automatically detect whether
     communication via UDP is possible or not.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Scripts,  Next: How to configure,  Prev: Host configuration variables,  Up: Configuration files

4.4.3 Scripts
-------------

Apart from reading the server and host configuration files, tinc can
also run scripts at certain moments.  Under Windows (not Cygwin), the
scripts should have the extension .bat.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-up'
     This is the most important script.  If it is present it will be
     executed right after the tinc daemon has been started and has
     connected to the virtual network device.  It should be used to set
     up the corresponding network interface, but can also be used to
     start other things.  Under Windows you can use the Network
     Connections control panel instead of creating this script.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-down'
     This script is started right before the tinc daemon quits.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/HOST-up'
     This script is started when the tinc daemon with name HOST becomes
     reachable.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/HOST-down'
     This script is started when the tinc daemon with name HOST becomes
     unreachable.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/host-up'
     This script is started when any host becomes reachable.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/host-down'
     This script is started when any host becomes unreachable.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/subnet-up'
     This script is started when a Subnet becomes reachable.  The
     Subnet and the node it belongs to are passed in environment
     variables.

`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/subnet-down'
     This script is started when a Subnet becomes unreachable.

   The scripts are started without command line arguments, but can make
use of certain environment variables.  Under UNIX like operating
systems the names of environment variables must be preceded by a $ in
scripts.  Under Windows, in `.bat' files, they have to be put between %
signs.

`NETNAME'
     If a netname was specified, this environment variable contains it.

`NAME'
     Contains the name of this tinc daemon.

`DEVICE'
     Contains the name of the virtual network device that tinc uses.

`INTERFACE'
     Contains the name of the virtual network interface that tinc uses.
     This should be used for commands like ifconfig.

`NODE'
     When a host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to its name.  If a
     subnet becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the owner of that
     subnet.

`REMOTEADDRESS'
     When a host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to its real address.

`REMOTEPORT'
     When a host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the port number
     it uses for communication with other tinc daemons.

`SUBNET'
     When a subnet becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the subnet.

`WEIGHT'
     When a subnet becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the subnet
     weight.



File: tinc.info,  Node: How to configure,  Prev: Scripts,  Up: Configuration files

4.4.4 How to configure
----------------------

Step 1.  Creating the main configuration file
.............................................

The main configuration file will be called
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf'.  Adapt the following example to create a
basic configuration file:

     Name = YOURNAME
     Device = `/dev/tap0'

   Then, if you know to which other tinc daemon(s) yours is going to
connect, add `ConnectTo' values.

Step 2.  Creating your host configuration file
..............................................

If you added a line containing `Name = yourname' in the main
configuarion file, you will need to create a host configuration file
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/yourname'.  Adapt the following example to
create a host configuration file:

     Address = your.real.hostname.org
     Subnet = 192.168.1.0/24

   You can also use an IP address instead of a hostname.  The `Subnet'
specifies the address range that is local for _your part of the VPN
only_.  If you have multiple address ranges you can specify more than
one `Subnet'.  You might also need to add a `Port' if you want your
tinc daemon to run on a different port number than the default (655).


File: tinc.info,  Node: Generating keypairs,  Next: Network interfaces,  Prev: Configuration files,  Up: Configuration

4.5 Generating keypairs
=======================

Now that you have already created the main configuration file and your
host configuration file, you can easily create a public/private keypair
by entering the following command:

     tincd -n NETNAME -K

   Tinc will generate a public and a private key and ask you where to
put them.  Just press enter to accept the defaults.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Network interfaces,  Next: Example configuration,  Prev: Generating keypairs,  Up: Configuration

4.6 Network interfaces
======================

Before tinc can start transmitting data over the tunnel, it must set up
the virtual network interface.

   First, decide which IP addresses you want to have associated with
these devices, and what network mask they must have.

   Tinc will open a virtual network device (`/dev/tun', `/dev/tap0' or
similar), which will also create a network interface called something
like `tun0', `tap0'.  If you are using the Linux tun/tap driver, the
network interface will by default have the same name as the NETNAME.
Under Windows you can change the name of the network interface from the
Network Connections control panel.

   You can configure the network interface by putting ordinary
ifconfig, route, and other commands to a script named
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-up'.  When tinc starts, this script will be
executed. When tinc exits, it will execute the script named
`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-down', but normally you don't need to create
that script.

   An example `tinc-up' script:

     #!/bin/sh
     ifconfig $INTERFACE 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0

   This script gives the interface an IP address and a netmask.  The
kernel will also automatically add a route to this interface, so
normally you don't need to add route commands to the `tinc-up' script.
The kernel will also bring the interface up after this command.  The
netmask is the mask of the _entire_ VPN network, not just your own
subnet.

   The exact syntax of the ifconfig and route commands differs from
platform to platform.  You can look up the commands for setting
addresses and adding routes in *note Platform specific information::,
but it is best to consult the manpages of those utilities on your
platform.


File: tinc.info,  Node: Example configuration,  Prev: Network interfaces,  Up: Configuration

4.7 Example configuration
=========================

Imagine the following situation.  Branch A of our example `company'
wants to connect three branch offices in B, C and D using the Internet.
All four offices have a 24/7 connection to the Internet.

   A is going to serve as the center of the network.  B and C will
connect to A, and D will connect to C.  Each office will be assigned
their own IP network, 10.x.0.0.

     A: net 10.1.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 gateway 10.1.54.1 internet IP 1.2.3.4
     B: net 10.2.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 gateway 10.2.1.12 internet IP 2.3.4.5
     C: net 10.3.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 gateway 10.3.69.254 internet IP 3.4.5.6
     D: net 10.4.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 gateway 10.4.3.32 internet IP 4.5.6.7

   Here, "gateway" is the VPN IP address of the machine that is running
the tincd, and "internet IP" is the IP address of the firewall, which
does not need to run tincd, but it must do a port forwarding of TCP and
UDP on port 655 (unless otherwise configured).

   In this example, it is assumed that eth0 is the interface that
points to the inner (physical) LAN of the office, although this could
also be the same as the interface that leads to the Internet.  The
configuration of the real interface is also shown as a comment, to give
you an idea of how these example host is set up. All branches use the
netname `company' for this particular VPN.

For Branch A
............

_BranchA_ would be configured like this:

   In `/etc/tinc/company/tinc-up':

     # Real interface of internal network:
     # ifconfig eth0 10.1.54.1 netmask 255.255.0.0

     ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.1.54.1 netmask 255.0.0.0

   and in `/etc/tinc/company/tinc.conf':

     Name = BranchA
     Device = /dev/tap0

   On all hosts, `/etc/tinc/company/hosts/BranchA' contains:

     Subnet = 10.1.0.0/16
     Address = 1.2.3.4

     -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
     ...
     -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

   Note that the IP addresses of eth0 and tap0 are the same.  This is
quite possible, if you make sure that the netmasks of the interfaces
are different.  It is in fact recommended to give both real internal
network interfaces and tap interfaces the same IP address, since that
will make things a lot easier to remember and set up.

For Branch B
............

In `/etc/tinc/company/tinc-up':

     # Real interface of internal network:
     # ifconfig eth0 10.2.43.8 netmask 255.255.0.0

     ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.2.1.12 netmask 255.0.0.0

   and in `/etc/tinc/company/tinc.conf':

     Name = BranchB
     ConnectTo = BranchA

   Note here that the internal address (on eth0) doesn't have to be the
same as on the tap0 device.  Also, ConnectTo is given so that this node
will always try to connect to BranchA.

   On all hosts, in `/etc/tinc/company/hosts/BranchB':

     Subnet = 10.2.0.0/16
     Address = 2.3.4.5

     -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
     ...
     -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

For Branch C
............

In `/etc/tinc/company/tinc-up':

     # Real interface of internal network:
     # ifconfig eth0 10.3.69.254 netmask 255.255.0.0

     ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.3.69.254 netmask 255.0.0.0

   and in `/etc/tinc/company/tinc.conf':

     Name = BranchC
     ConnectTo = BranchA
     Device = /dev/tap1

   C already has another daemon that runs on port 655, so they have to
reserve another port for tinc. It knows the portnumber it has to listen
on from it's own host configuration file.

   On all hosts, in `/etc/tinc/company/hosts/BranchC':

     Address = 3.4.5.6
     Subnet = 10.3.0.0/16
     Port = 2000

     -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
     ...
     -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

For Branch D
............

In `/etc/tinc/company/tinc-up':

     # Real interface of internal network:
     # ifconfig eth0 10.4.3.32 netmask 255.255.0.0

     ifconfig $INTERFACE 10.4.3.32 netmask 255.0.0.0

   and in `/etc/tinc/company/tinc.conf':

     Name = BranchD
     ConnectTo = BranchC
     Device = /dev/net/tun

   D will be connecting to C, which has a tincd running for this
network on port 2000. It knows the port number from the host
configuration file.  Also note that since D uses the tun/tap driver,
the network interface will not be called `tun' or `tap0' or something
like that, but will have the same name as netname.

   On all hosts, in `/etc/tinc/company/hosts/BranchD':

     Subnet = 10.4.0.0/16
     Address = 4.5.6.7

     -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
     ...
     -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

Key files
.........

A, B, C and D all have generated a public/private keypair with the
following command:

     tincd -n company -K

   The private key is stored in `/etc/tinc/company/rsa_key.priv', the
public key is put into the host configuration file in the
`/etc/tinc/company/hosts/' directory.  During key generation, tinc
automatically guesses the right filenames based on the -n option and
the Name directive in the `tinc.conf' file (if it is available).

Starting
........

After each branch has finished configuration and they have distributed
the host configuration files amongst them, they can start their tinc
daemons.  They don't necessarily have to wait for the other branches to
have started their daemons, tinc will try connecting until they are
available.

5 Running tinc
**************

If everything else is done, you can start tinc by typing the following
command:

     tincd -n NETNAME

   Tinc will detach from the terminal and continue to run in the
background like a good daemon.  If there are any problems however you
can try to increase the debug level and look in the syslog to find out
what the problems are.

File: tinc.info,  Node: Runtime options,  Next: Signals,  Up: Running tinc

5.1 Runtime options
===================

Besides the settings in the configuration file, tinc also accepts some
command line options.

`-c, --config=PATH'
     Read configuration options from the directory PATH.  The default is
     `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/'.

`-D, --no-detach'
     Don't fork and detach.  This will also disable the automatic
     restart mechanism for fatal errors.

`-d, --debug=LEVEL'
     Set debug level to LEVEL.  The higher the debug level, the more
     gets logged.  Everything goes via syslog.

`-k, --kill[=SIGNAL]'
     Attempt to kill a running tincd (optionally with the specified
     SIGNAL instead of SIGTERM) and exit.  Use it in conjunction with
     the -n option to make sure you kill the right tinc daemon.  Under
     native Windows the optional argument is ignored, the service will
     always be stopped and removed.

`-n, --net=NETNAME'
     Use configuration for net NETNAME.  This will let tinc read all
     configuration files from `/etc/tinc/NETNAME/'.  Specifying . for
     NETNAME is the same as not specifying any NETNAME.  *Note Multiple
     networks::.

`-K, --generate-keys[=BITS]'
     Generate public/private keypair of BITS length. If BITS is not
     specified, 2048 is the default. tinc will ask where you want to
     store the files, but will default to the configuration directory
     (you can use the -c or -n option in combination with -K). After
     that, tinc will quit.

`-o, --option=[HOST.]KEY=VALUE'
     Without specifying a HOST, this will set server configuration
     variable KEY to VALUE.  If specified as HOST.KEY=VALUE, this will
     set the host configuration variable KEY of the host named HOST to
     VALUE.  This option can be used more than once to specify multiple
     configuration variables.

`-L, --mlock'
     Lock tinc into main memory.  This will prevent sensitive data like
     shared private keys to be written to the system swap
     files/partitions.

`--logfile[=FILE]'
     Write log entries to a file instead of to the system logging
     facility.  If FILE is omitted, the default is
     `/var/log/tinc.NETNAME.log'.

`--pidfile=FILE'
     Write PID to FILE instead of `/var/run/tinc.NETNAME.pid'.

`--bypass-security'
     Disables encryption and authentication.  Only useful for debugging.

`-R, --chroot'
     Change process root directory to the directory where the config
     file is located (`/etc/tinc/NETNAME/' as determined by -n/-net
     option or as given by -c/-config option), for added security.  The
     chroot is performed after all the initialization is done, after
     writing pid files and opening network sockets.

     Note that this option alone does not do any good without -U/-user,
     below.

     Note also that tinc can't run scripts anymore (such as tinc-down
     or host-up), unless it's setup to be runnable inside chroot
     environment.

`-U, --user=USER'
     Switch to the given USER after initialization, at the same time as
     chroot is performed (see -chroot above).  With this option tinc
     drops privileges, for added security.

`--help'
     Display a short reminder of these runtime options and terminate.

`--version'
     Output version information and exit.



File: tinc.info,  Node: Signals,  Next: Debug levels,  Prev: Runtime options,  Up: Running tinc

5.2 Signals
===========

You can also send the following signals to a running tincd process:

`ALRM'
     Forces tinc to try to connect to all uplinks immediately.  Usually
     tinc attempts to do this itself, but increases the time it waits
     between the attempts each time it failed, and if tinc didn't
     succeed to connect to an uplink the first time after it started,
     it defaults to the maximum time of 15 minutes.

`HUP'
     Partially rereads configuration files.  Connections to hosts whose
     host config file are removed are closed.  New outgoing connections
     specified in `tinc.conf' will be made.  If the -logfile option is
     used, this will also close and reopen the log file, useful when
     log rotation is used.

`INT'
     Temporarily increases debug level to 5.  Send this signal again to
     revert to the original level.

`USR1'
     Dumps the connection list to syslog.

`USR2'
     Dumps virtual network device statistics, all known nodes, edges
     and subnets to syslog.

`WINCH'
     Purges all information remembered about unreachable nodes.



File: tinc.info,  Node: Debug levels,  Next: Solving problems,  Prev: Signals,  Up: Running tinc

5.3 Debug levels
================

The tinc daemon can send a lot of messages to the syslog.  The higher
the debug level, the more messages it will log.  Each level inherits
all messages of the previous level:

`0'
     This will log a message indicating tinc has started along with a
     version number.  It will also log any serious error.

`1'
     This will log all connections that are made with other tinc
     daemons.

`2'
     This will log status and error messages from scripts and other
     tinc daemons.

`3'
     This will log all requests that are exchanged with other tinc
     daemons. These include authentication, key exchange and connection
     list updates.

`4'
     This will log a copy of everything received on the meta socket.

`5'
     This will log all network traffic over the virtual private network.



File: tinc.info,  Node: Solving problems,  Next: Error messages,  Prev: Debug levels,  Up: Running tinc

5.4 Solving problems
====================

If tinc starts without problems, but if the VPN doesn't work, you will
have to find the cause of the problem.  The first thing to do is to
start tinc with a high debug level in the foreground, so you can
directly see everything tinc logs:

     tincd -n NETNAME -d5 -D

   If tinc does not log any error messages, then you might want to
check the following things:

   * `tinc-up' script Does this script contain the right commands?
     Normally you must give the interface the address of this host on
     the VPN, and the netmask must be big enough so that the entire VPN
     is covered.

   * Subnet Does the Subnet (or Subnets) in the host configuration file
     of this host match the portion of the VPN that belongs to this
     host?

   * Firewalls and NATs Do you have a firewall or a NAT device (a
     masquerading firewall or perhaps an ADSL router that performs
     masquerading)?  If so, check that it allows TCP and UDP traffic on
     port 655.  If it masquerades and the host running tinc is behind
     it, make sure that it forwards TCP and UDP traffic to port 655 to
     the host running tinc.  You can add `TCPOnly = yes' to your host
     config file to force tinc to only use a single TCP connection,
     this works through most firewalls and NATs. Since version 1.0.10,
     tinc will automatically fall back to TCP if direct communication
     via UDP is not possible.



File: tinc.info,  Node: Error messages,  Next: Sending bug reports,  Prev: Solving problems,  Up: Running tinc

5.5 Error messages
==================

What follows is a list of the most common error messages you might find
in the logs.  Some of them will only be visible if the debug level is
high enough.

`Could not open /dev/tap0: No such device'
        * You forgot to `modprobe netlink_dev' or `modprobe ethertap'.

        * You forgot to compile `Netlink device emulation' in the
          kernel.

`Can't write to /dev/net/tun: No such device'
        * You forgot to `modprobe tun'.

        * You forgot to compile `Universal TUN/TAP driver' in the
          kernel.

        * The tun device is located somewhere else in `/dev/'.

`Network address and prefix length do not match!'
        * The Subnet field must contain a _network_ address, trailing
          bits should be 0.

        * If you only want to use one IP address, set the netmask to
          /32.

`Error reading RSA key file `rsa_key.priv': No such file or directory'
        * You forgot to create a public/private keypair.

        * Specify the complete pathname to the private key file with
          the `PrivateKeyFile' option.

`Warning: insecure file permissions for RSA private key file `rsa_key.priv'!'
        * The private key file is readable by users other than root.
          Use chmod to correct the file permissions.

`Creating metasocket failed: Address family not supported'
        * By default tinc tries to create both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.
          On some platforms this might not be implemented.  If the logs
          show `Ready' later on, then at least one metasocket was
          created, and you can ignore this message.  You can add
          `AddressFamily = ipv4' to `tinc.conf' to prevent this from
          happening.

`Cannot route packet: unknown IPv4 destination 1.2.3.4'
        * You try to send traffic to a host on the VPN for which no
          Subnet is known.

        * If it is a broadcast address (ending in .255), it probably is
          a samba server or a Windows host sending broadcast packets.
          You can ignore it.

`Cannot route packet: ARP request for unknown address 1.2.3.4'
        * You try to send traffic to a host on the VPN for which no
          Subnet is known.

`Packet with destination 1.2.3.4 is looping back to us!'
        * Something is not configured right. Packets are being sent out
          to the virtual network device, but according to the Subnet
          directives in your host configuration file, those packets
          should go to your own host. Most common mistake is that you
          have a Subnet line in your host configuration file with a
          prefix length which is just as large as the prefix of the
          virtual network interface. The latter should in almost all
          cases be larger. Rethink your configuration.  Note that you
          will only see this message if you specified a debug level of
          5 or higher!

        * Chances are that a `Subnet = ...' line in the host
          configuration file of this tinc daemon is wrong.  Change it
          to a subnet that is accepted locally by another interface, or
          if that is not the case, try changing the prefix length into
          /32.

`Node foo (1.2.3.4) is not reachable'
        * Node foo does not have a connection anymore, its tinc daemon
          is not running or its connection to the Internet is broken.

`Received UDP packet from unknown source 1.2.3.4 (port 12345)'
        * If you see this only sporadically, it is harmless and caused
          by a node sending packets using an old key.

`Got bad/bogus/unauthorized REQUEST from foo (1.2.3.4 port 12345)'
        * Node foo does not have the right public/private keypair.
          Generate new keypairs and distribute them again.

        * An attacker tries to gain access to your VPN.

        * A network error caused corruption of metadata sent from foo.

5.6 Sending bug reports
=======================

If you really can't find the cause of a problem, or if you suspect tinc
is not working right, you can send us a bugreport, see *note Contact
information::.  Be sure to include the following information in your
bugreport:

   * A clear description of what you are trying to achieve and what the
     problem is.

   * What platform (operating system, version, hardware architecture)
     and which version of tinc you use.

   * If compiling tinc fails, a copy of `config.log' and the error
     messages you get.

   * Otherwise, a copy of `tinc.conf', `tinc-up' and all files in the
     `hosts/' directory.

   * The output of the commands `ifconfig -a' and `route -n' (or
     `netstat -rn' if that doesn't work).

   * The output of any command that fails to work as it should (like
     ping or traceroute).

File: tinc.info,  Node: The connection,  Next: The meta-protocol,  Up: Technical information

6.1 The connection
==================

Tinc is a daemon that takes VPN data and transmit that to another host
computer over the existing Internet infrastructure.

* Menu:

* The UDP tunnel::
* The meta-connection::


File: tinc.info,  Node: The UDP tunnel,  Next: The meta-connection,  Up: The connection

6.1.1 The UDP tunnel
--------------------

The data itself is read from a character device file, the so-called
_virtual network device_.  This device is associated with a network
interface.  Any data sent to this interface can be read from the device,
and any data written to the device gets sent from the interface.  There
are two possible types of virtual network devices: `tun' style, which
are point-to-point devices which can only handle IPv4 and/or IPv6
packets, and `tap' style, which are Ethernet devices and handle
complete Ethernet frames.

   So when tinc reads an Ethernet frame from the device, it determines
its type. When tinc is in it's default routing mode, it can handle IPv4
and IPv6 packets. Depending on the Subnet lines, it will send the
packets off to their destination IP address.  In the `switch' and `hub'
mode, tinc will use broadcasts and MAC address discovery to deduce the
destination of the packets.  Since the latter modes only depend on the
link layer information, any protocol that runs over Ethernet is
supported (for instance IPX and Appletalk).  However, only `tap' style
devices provide this information.

   After the destination has been determined, the packet will be
compressed (optionally), a sequence number will be added to the packet,
the packet will then be encrypted and a message authentication code
will be appended.

   When that is done, time has come to actually transport the packet to
the destination computer.  We do this by sending the packet over an UDP
connection to the destination host.  This is called _encapsulating_,
the VPN packet (though now encrypted) is encapsulated in another IP
datagram.

   When the destination receives this packet, the same thing happens,
only in reverse.  So it checks the message authentication code,
decrypts the contents of the UDP datagram, checks the sequence number
and writes the decrypted information to its own virtual network device.

   If the virtual network device is a `tun' device (a point-to-point
tunnel), there is no problem for the kernel to accept a packet.
However, if it is a `tap' device (this is the only available type on
FreeBSD), the destination MAC address must match that of the virtual
network interface.  If tinc is in it's default routing mode, ARP does
not work, so the correct destination MAC can not be known by the
sending host.  Tinc solves this by letting the receiving end detect the
MAC address of its own virtual network interface and overwriting the
destination MAC address of the received packet.

   In switch or hub modes ARP does work so the sender already knows the
correct destination MAC address.  In those modes every interface should
have a unique MAC address, so make sure they are not the same.  Because
switch and hub modes rely on MAC addresses to function correctly, these
modes cannot be used on the following operating systems which don't
have a `tap' style virtual network device: OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin and
Solaris.


File: tinc.info,  Node: The meta-connection,  Prev: The UDP tunnel,  Up: The connection

6.1.2 The meta-connection
-------------------------

Having only a UDP connection available is not enough.  Though suitable
for transmitting data, we want to be able to reliably send other
information, such as routing and session key information to somebody.

   TCP is a better alternative, because it already contains protection
against information being lost, unlike UDP.

   So we establish two connections.  One for the encrypted VPN data,
and one for other information, the meta-data.  Hence, we call the second
connection the meta-connection.  We can now be sure that the
meta-information doesn't get lost on the way to another computer.

   Like with any communication, we must have a protocol, so that
everybody knows what everything stands for, and how she should react.
Because we have two connections, we also have two protocols.  The
protocol used for the UDP data is the "data-protocol," the other one is
the "meta-protocol."

   The reason we don't use TCP for both protocols is that UDP is much
better for encapsulation, even while it is less reliable.  The real
problem is that when TCP would be used to encapsulate a TCP stream
that's on the private network, for every packet sent there would be
three ACKs sent instead of just one.  Furthermore, if there would be a
timeout, both TCP streams would sense the timeout, and both would start
re-sending packets.


File: tinc.info,  Node: The meta-protocol,  Next: Security,  Prev: The connection,  Up: Technical information

6.2 The meta-protocol
=====================

The meta protocol is used to tie all tinc daemons together, and
exchange information about which tinc daemon serves which virtual
subnet.

   The meta protocol consists of requests that can be sent to the other
side.  Each request has a unique number and several parameters.  All
requests are represented in the standard ASCII character set.  It is
possible to use tools such as telnet or netcat to connect to a tinc
daemon started with the -bypass-security option and to read and write
requests by hand, provided that one understands the numeric codes sent.

   The authentication scheme is described in *note Authentication
protocol::. After a successful authentication, the server and the
client will exchange all the information about other tinc daemons and
subnets they know of, so that both sides (and all the other tinc
daemons behind them) have their information synchronised.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

   The keys used to encrypt VPN packets are not sent out directly. This
is because it would generate a lot of traffic on VPNs with many
daemons, and chances are that not every tinc daemon will ever send a
packet to every other daemon. Instead, if a daemon needs a key it sends
a request for it via the meta connection of the nearest hop in the
direction of the destination.

     daemon	message
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     origin	PING
     dest.	PONG
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

   There is also a mechanism to check if hosts are still alive. Since
network failures or a crash can cause a daemon to be killed without
properly shutting down the TCP connection, this is necessary to keep an
up to date connection list. PINGs are sent at regular intervals, except
when there is also some other traffic. A little bit of salt (random
data) is added with each PING and PONG message, to make sure that long
sequences of PING/PONG messages without any other traffic won't result
in known plaintext.

   This basically covers what is sent over the meta connection by tinc.

6.3 Security
============

Tinc got its name from "TINC," short for _There Is No Cabal_; the
alleged Cabal was/is an organisation that was said to keep an eye on the
entire Internet.  As this is exactly what you _don't_ want, we named
the tinc project after TINC.

   But in order to be "immune" to eavesdropping, you'll have to encrypt
your data.  Because tinc is a _Secure_ VPN (SVPN) daemon, it does
exactly that: encrypt.  Tinc by default uses blowfish encryption with
128 bit keys in CBC mode, 32 bit sequence numbers and 4 byte long
message authentication codes to make sure eavesdroppers cannot get and
cannot change any information at all from the packets they can
intercept. The encryption algorithm and message authentication
algorithm can be changed in the configuration. The length of the message
authentication codes is also adjustable. The length of the key for the
encryption algorithm is always the default length used by OpenSSL.

File: tinc.info,  Node: Authentication protocol,  Next: Encryption of network packets,  Up: Security

6.3.1 Authentication protocol
-----------------------------

A new scheme for authentication in tinc has been devised, which offers
some improvements over the protocol used in 1.0pre2 and 1.0pre3.
Explanation is below.

     daemon  message
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     client  <attempts connection>

     server  <accepts connection>

     client  ID client 12
                   |   +---> version
                   +-------> name of tinc daemon

     server  ID server 12
                   |   +---> version
                   +-------> name of tinc daemon

     client  META_KEY 5f0823a93e35b69e...7086ec7866ce582b
                      \_________________________________/
                                      +-> RSAKEYLEN bits totally random string S1,
                                          encrypted with server's public RSA key

     server  META_KEY 6ab9c1640388f8f0...45d1a07f8a672630
                      \_________________________________/
                                      +-> RSAKEYLEN bits totally random string S2,
                                          encrypted with client's public RSA key

     From now on:
      - the client will symmetrically encrypt outgoing traffic using S1
      - the server will symmetrically encrypt outgoing traffic using S2

     client  CHALLENGE da02add1817c1920989ba6ae2a49cecbda0
                       \_________________________________/
                                      +-> CHALLEN bits totally random string H1

     server  CHALLENGE 57fb4b2ccd70d6bb35a64c142f47e61d57f
                       \_________________________________/
                                      +-> CHALLEN bits totally random string H2

     client  CHAL_REPLY 816a86
                           +-> 160 bits SHA1 of H2

     server  CHAL_REPLY 928ffe
                           +-> 160 bits SHA1 of H1

     After the correct challenge replies are received, both ends have proved
     their identity. Further information is exchanged.

     client  ACK 655 123 0
                  |   |  +-> options
     	         |   +----> estimated weight
     	         +--------> listening port of client

     server  ACK 655 321 0
                  |   |  +-> options
     	         |   +----> estimated weight
     	         +--------> listening port of server
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This new scheme has several improvements, both in efficiency and
security.

   First of all, the server sends exactly the same kind of messages
over the wire as the client. The previous versions of tinc first
authenticated the client, and then the server. This scheme even allows
both sides to send their messages simultaneously, there is no need to
wait for the other to send something first.  This means that any
calculations that need to be done upon sending or receiving a message
can also be done in parallel. This is especially important when doing
RSA encryption/decryption. Given that these calculations are the main
part of the CPU time spent for the authentication, speed is improved by
a factor 2.

   Second, only one RSA encrypted message is sent instead of two. This
reduces the amount of information attackers can see (and thus use for a
cryptographic attack). It also improves speed by a factor two, making
the total speedup a factor 4.

   Third, and most important: The symmetric cipher keys are exchanged
first, the challenge is done afterwards. In the previous authentication
scheme, because a man-in-the-middle could pass the challenge/chal_reply
phase (by just copying the messages between the two real tinc daemons),
but no information was exchanged that was really needed to read the
rest of the messages, the challenge/chal_reply phase was of no real
use. The man-in-the-middle was only stopped by the fact that only after
the ACK messages were encrypted with the symmetric cipher. Potentially,
it could even send it's own symmetric key to the server (if it knew the
server's public key) and read some of the metadata the server would
send it (it was impossible for the mitm to read actual network packets
though). The new scheme however prevents this.

   This new scheme makes sure that first of all, symmetric keys are
exchanged. The rest of the messages are then encrypted with the
symmetric cipher. Then, each side can only read received messages if
they have their private key. The challenge is there to let the other
side know that the private key is really known, because a challenge
reply can only be sent back if the challenge is decrypted correctly,
and that can only be done with knowledge of the private key.

   Fourth: the first thing that is sent via the symmetric cipher
encrypted connection is a totally random string, so that there is no
known plaintext (for an attacker) in the beginning of the encrypted
stream.

6.3.2 Encryption of network packets
-----------------------------------

A data packet can only be sent if the encryption key is known to both
parties, and the connection is  activated. If the encryption key is not
known, a request is sent to the destination using the meta connection
to retrieve it. The packet is stored in a queue while waiting for the
key to arrive.

   The UDP packet containing the network packet from the VPN has the
following layout:

     ... | IP header | UDP header | seqno | VPN packet | MAC | UDP trailer
                                  \___________________/\_____/
                                            |             |
                                            V             +---> digest algorithm
                              Encrypted with symmetric cipher

   So, the entire VPN packet is encrypted using a symmetric cipher,
including a 32 bits sequence number that is added in front of the
actual VPN packet, to act as a unique IV for each packet and to prevent
replay attacks. A message authentication code is added to the UDP
packet to prevent alteration of packets. By default the first 4 bytes
of the digest are used for this, but this can be changed using the
MACLength configuration variable.

6.3.3 Security issues
---------------------

In August 2000, we discovered the existence of a security hole in all
versions of tinc up to and including 1.0pre2. This had to do with the
way we exchanged keys. Since then, we have been working on a new
authentication scheme to make tinc as secure as possible. The current
version uses the OpenSSL library and uses strong authentication with
RSA keys.

   On the 29th of December 2001, Jerome Etienne posted a security
analysis of tinc 1.0pre4. Due to a lack of sequence numbers and a
message authentication code for each packet, an attacker could possibly
disrupt certain network services or launch a denial of service attack
by replaying intercepted packets. The current version adds sequence
numbers and message authentication codes to prevent such attacks.

   On the 15th of September 2003, Peter Gutmann posted a security
analysis of tinc 1.0.1. He argues that the 32 bit sequence number used
by tinc is not a good IV, that tinc's default length of 4 bytes for the
MAC is too short, and he doesn't like tinc's use of RSA during
authentication. We do not know of a security hole in this version of
tinc, but tinc's security is not as strong as TLS or IPsec.  We will
address these issues in tinc 2.0.

   Cryptography is a hard thing to get right. We cannot make any
guarantees. Time, review and feedback are the only things that can
prove the security of any cryptographic product. If you wish to review
tinc or give us feedback, you are stronly encouraged to do so.

* Interface configuration::
* Routes::


File: tinc.info,  Node: Interface configuration,  Next: Routes,  Up: Platform specific information

7.1 Interface configuration
===========================

When configuring an interface, one normally assigns it an address and a
netmask.  The address uniquely identifies the host on the network
attached to the interface.  The netmask, combined with the address,
forms a subnet.  It is used to add a route to the routing table
instructing the kernel to send all packets which fall into that subnet
to that interface.  Because all packets for the entire VPN should go to
the virtual network interface used by tinc, the netmask should be such
that it encompasses the entire VPN.

   For IPv4 addresses:

Linux              `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
Linux iproute2     `ip addr add' ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH `dev' INTERFACE
FreeBSD            `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
OpenBSD            `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
NetBSD             `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
Solaris            `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
Darwin (MacOS/X)   `ifconfig' INTERFACE ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK
Windows            `netsh interface ip set address' INTERFACE `static' ADDRESS NETMASK

   For IPv6 addresses:

Linux              `ifconfig' INTERFACE `add' ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH
FreeBSD            `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6' ADDRESS `prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
OpenBSD            `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6' ADDRESS `prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
NetBSD             `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6' ADDRESS `prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
Solaris            `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6 plumb up'
                   `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6 addif' ADDRESS ADDRESS
Darwin (MacOS/X)   `ifconfig' INTERFACE `inet6' ADDRESS `prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
Windows            `netsh interface ipv6 add address' INTERFACE `static' ADDRESS/PREFIXLENGTH

   On some platforms, when running tinc in switch mode, the VPN
interface must be set to tap mode with an ifconfig command:

OpenBSD            `ifconfig' INTERFACE `link0'

   On Linux, it is possible to create a persistent tun/tap interface
which will continue to exist even if tinc quit, although this is
normally not required.  It can be useful to set up a tun/tap interface
owned by a non-root user, so tinc can be started without needing any
root privileges at all.

Linux              `ip tuntap add dev' INTERFACE `mode' TUN|TAP `user' USERNAME


File: tinc.info,  Node: Routes,  Prev: Interface configuration,  Up: Platform specific information

7.2 Routes
==========

In some cases it might be necessary to add more routes to the virtual
network interface.  There are two ways to indicate which interface a
packet should go to, one is to use the name of the interface itself,
another way is to specify the (local) address that is assigned to that
interface (LOCAL_ADDRESS). The former way is unambiguous and therefore
preferable, but not all platforms support this.

   Adding routes to IPv4 subnets:

Linux              `route add -net' NETWORK_ADDRESS `netmask' NETMASK INTERFACE
Linux iproute2     `ip route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH `dev' INTERFACE
FreeBSD            `route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS
OpenBSD            `route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS
NetBSD             `route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS
Solaris            `route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS `-interface'
Darwin (MacOS/X)   `route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS
Windows            `netsh routing ip add persistentroute' NETWORK_ADDRESS NETMASK INTERFACE
                   LOCAL_ADDRESS

   Adding routes to IPv6 subnets:

Linux              `route add -A inet6' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH INTERFACE
Linux iproute2     `ip route add' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH `dev' INTERFACE
FreeBSD            `route add -inet6' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS
OpenBSD            `route add -inet6' NETWORK_ADDRESS LOCAL_ADDRESS `-prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
NetBSD             `route add -inet6' NETWORK_ADDRESS LOCAL_ADDRESS `-prefixlen' PREFIXLENGTH
Solaris            `route add -inet6' NETWORK_ADDRESS`/'PREFIXLENGTH LOCAL_ADDRESS `-interface'
Darwin (MacOS/X)   ?
Windows            `netsh interface ipv6 add route' NETWORK ADDRESS/PREFIXLENGTH INTERFACE
