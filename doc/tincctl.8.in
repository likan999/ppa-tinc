.Sh NAME
.Nm tincctl
.Nd tinc VPN control
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cn
.Op Fl -config Ns = Ns Ar DIR
.Op Fl -net Ns = Ns Ar NETNAME
.Op Fl -pidfile Ns = Ns Ar FILENAME
.Op Fl -help
.Op Fl -version
.Ar COMMAND
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the control program of tinc, a secure virtual private network (VPN)
project.
.Nm
communicates with
.Xr tincd 8
to alter and inspect the running VPN's state.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n, -net Ns = Ns Ar NETNAME
Communicate with tincd(8) connected with
.Ar NETNAME .
.It Fl -pidfile Ns = Ns Ar FILENAME
Use the cookie from
.Ar FILENAME
to authenticate with a running tinc daemon.
If unspecified, the default is
.Pa @localstatedir@/run/tinc. Ns Ar NETNAME Ns Pa .pid.
.It Fl -help
Display short list of options.
.It Fl -version
Output version information and exit.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev NETNAME
If no netname is specified on the command line with the
.Fl n
option, the value of this environment variable is used.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It init Op Ar name
Create initial configuration files and RSA and ECDSA keypairs with default length.
If no
.Ar name
for this node is given, it will be asked for.
.It config Oo get Oc Ar variable
Print the current value of configuration variable
.Ar variable .
If more than one variable with the same name exists,
the value of each of them will be printed on a separate line.
.It config Oo set Oc Ar variable Ar value
Set configuration variable
.Ar variable
to the given
.Ar value .
All previously existing configuration variables with the same name are removed.
To set a variable for a specific host, use the notation
.Ar host Ns Li . Ns Ar variable .
.It config add Ar variable Ar value
As above, but without removing any previously existing configuration variables.
.It config del Ar variable Op Ar value
Remove configuration variables with the same name and
.Ar value .
If no
.Ar value
is given, all configuration variables with the same name will be removed.
.It edit Ar filename
Start an editor for the given configuration file.
You do not need to specify the full path to the file.
.It export
Export the host configuration file of the local node to standard output.
.It export-all
Export all host configuration files to standard output.
.It import Op Fl -force
Import host configuration file(s) from standard input.
Already existing host configuration files are not overwritten unless the option
.Fl -force
is used.
.It start Op tincd options
Start
.Xr tincd 8 ,
optionally with the given extra options.
.It stop
Stop
.Xr tincd 8 .
.It restart
Restart
.Xr tincd 8 .
.It reload
Partially rereads configuration files. Connections to hosts whose host
config files are removed are closed. New outgoing connections specified
in
.Xr tinc.conf 5
will be made.
.It pid
Shows the PID of the currently running
.Xr tincd 8 .
.It generate-keys Op bits
Generate both RSA and ECDSA keypairs (see below) and exit.
.It generate-ecdsa-keys
Generate public/private ECDSA keypair and exit.
.It generate-rsa-keys Op bits
Generate public/private RSA keypair and exit.
If
.Ar bits
is omitted, the default length will be 2048 bits.
When saving keys to existing files, tinc will not delete the old keys;
you have to remove them manually.
.It dump [reachable] nodes
Dump a list of all known nodes in the VPN.
If the keyword reachable is used, only lists reachable nodes.
.It dump edges
Dump a list of all known connections in the VPN.
.It dump subnets
Dump a list of all known subnets in the VPN.
.It dump connections
Dump a list of all meta connections with ourself.
.It dump graph | digraph
Dump a graph of the VPN in
.Xr dotty 1
format.
Nodes are colored according to their reachability:
red nodes are unreachable, orange nodes are indirectly reachable, green nodes are directly reachable.
Black nodes are either directly or indirectly reachable, but direct reachability has not been tried yet.
.It info Ar node | subnet | address
Show information about a particular node, subnet or address.
If an address is given, any matching subnet will be shown.
.It purge
Purges all information remembered about unreachable nodes.
.It debug Ar N
Sets debug level to
.Ar N .
.It log Op Ar N
Capture log messages from a running tinc daemon.
An optional debug level can be given that will be applied only for log messages sent to
.Nm tincctl .
.It retry
Forces
.Xr tincd 8
to try to connect to all uplinks immediately.
Usually
.Xr tincd 8
attempts to do this itself,
but increases the time it waits between the attempts each time it failed,
and if
.Xr tincd 8
didn't succeed to connect to an uplink the first time after it started,
it defaults to the maximum time of 15 minutes.
.It disconnect Ar NODE
Closes the meta connection with the given
.Ar NODE .
.It top
If
.Nm
is compiled with libcurses support, this will display live traffic statistics
for all the known nodes, similar to the UNIX
.Xr top 1
command.
See below for more information.
.It pcap
Dump VPN traffic going through the local tinc node in
.Xr pcap-savefile 5
format to standard output,
from where it can be redirected to a file or piped through a program that can parse it directly,
such as
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Examples of some commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tincctl -n vpn dump graph | circo -Txlib
tincctl -n vpn pcap | tcpdump -r -
tincctl -n vpn top

.Ed
Example of configuring tinc using
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tincctl -n vpn init foo
tincctl -n vpn config Subnet 192.168.1.0/24
tincctl -n vpn config bar.Address bar.example.com
tincctl -n vpn config ConnectTo bar
tincctl -n vpn export | gpg --clearsign | mail -s "My config" vpnmaster@example.com
.Ed
.Sh TOP
The top command connects to a running tinc daemon and repeatedly queries its per-node traffic counters.
It displays a list of all the known nodes in the left-most column,
and the amount of bytes and packets read from and sent to each node in the other columns.
By default, the information is updated every second.
The behaviour of the top command can be changed using the following keys:
.Bl -tag
.It Ic s
Change the interval between updates.
After pressing the
.Ic s
key, enter the desired interval in seconds, followed by enter.
Fractional seconds are honored.
Intervals lower than 0.1 seconds are not allowed.
.It Ic c
Toggle between displaying current traffic rates (in packets and bytes per second)
and cummulative traffic (total packets and bytes since the tinc daemon started).
.It Ic n
Sort the list of nodes by name.
.It Ic i
Sort the list of nodes by incoming amount of bytes.
.It Ic I
Sort the list of nodes by incoming amount of packets.
.It Ic o
Sort the list of nodes by outgoing amount of bytes.
.It Ic O
Sort the list of nodes by outgoing amount of packets.
.It Ic t
Sort the list of nodes by sum of incoming and outgoing amount of bytes.
.It Ic T
Sort the list of nodes by sum of incoming and outgoing amount of packets.
.It Ic b
Show amount of traffic in bytes.
.It Ic k
Show amount of traffic in kilobytes.
.It Ic M
Show amount of traffic in megabytes.
.It Ic G
Show amount of traffic in gigabytes.
.It Ic q
Quit.
