Description: Virtual Private Network daemon
 tinc is a daemon with which you can create a virtual private network
 (VPN).  One daemon can handle multiple connections, so you can
 create an entire (moderately sized) VPN with only one daemon per
 participating computer.
 .
 You need to have two kernel modules installed, on a Debian system
 they should already be there.  If they are not, the manual will
 explain you how to do that.
