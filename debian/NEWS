tinc (1.0.27-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This package now provides native systemd service files, allowing multiple
  instances of tinc to be managed. Existing networks listed in
  /etc/tinc/nets.boot will be converted to service instances once during this
  upgrade. Afterwards, you can enable and disable networks using:
  
    systemctl enable tinc@<netname>
    systemctl disable tinc@<netname>
  
  If you do not have systemd installed, the SysV init script will continue to
  work as usual. For more information, see README.Debian.
