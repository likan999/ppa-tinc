tinc (1.1~pre2-1) experimental; urgency=low

   tinc-1.1 has separate control utility, tincctl, which is now used
   to start/stop tinc instances, to reload configuration, to get
   various information about running tincd (including dump of nodes
   and connections) and so on.  tincd still reacts to some signals
   as before, but this usage is deprecated.  In particular, -k
   option is now gone.  Also, node/connection/etc dumps are
   produced on tincctl stdout, not into syslog.
