tinc (1.1~pre11-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This package now provides a native systemd service file, allowing multiple
  instances of tinc to be managed. Existing networks listed in
  /etc/tinc/nets.boot will be converted to service instances once during this
  upgrade. Afterwards, you can enable and disable networks using:

    systemctl enable tinc@<netname>
    systemctl disable tinc@<netname>

  If you do not have systemd installed, the SysV init script will continue to
  work as usual. For more information, see README.Debian.

  Please note that tinc 1.1pre11 is backwards compatible with tinc 1.0.x, but
  is not backwards compatible with 1.1pre1 to 1.1pre10 nodes if
  ExperimentalProtocol is enabled, which is the default.

  If you have more than one node running an 1.1 prerelease version in your VPN,
  make sure you upgrade them all at the same time, or disable the new protocol
  by adding the following line to tinc.conf:

    ExperimentalProtocol = no

  If you do want to use the new protocol, be aware that this version of tinc
  switched to Ed25519 keys. You can generate a new Ed25519 keypair by running
  the following command:

    tinc -n <netname> generate-ed25519-keys

  You have to manually restart tinc after this upgrade.

tinc (1.1~pre2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  tinc-1.1 has separate control utility, tinc (without the d), which is now
  used to start/stop tinc instances, to reload configuration, to get various
  information about running tincd (including dump of nodes and connections)
  and so on. tincd still reacts to some signals as before, but this usage is
  deprecated. In particular, -k option is now gone. Also, node/connection/etc
  dumps are produced on tincctl stdout, not into syslog.
