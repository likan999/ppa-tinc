    add (errnum) in front of windows error messages
    
    On localized, non-English versions of windows, it is
    common to have two active charsets -- for console applications
    and for GUI applications, together with localized error messages
    returned by windows.  But two charsets are rarely compatible,
    so sending the same byte sequence to console and to windows
    event log makes one or another to be unreadable.  So at least
    include the error number, this way it will be possible to
    lookup the actual error test using external ways.

    Proxy type "exec" can be used to have an external script or binary set
    up an outgoing connection. Standard input and output will be used to
    exchange data with the external command. The variables REMOTEADDRESS and
    REMOTEPORT are set to the intended destination address and port.

    Add basic support for SOCKS 4 and HTTP CONNECT proxies.
    
    When the Proxy option is used, outgoing connections will be made via the
    specified proxy. There is no support for authentication methods or for having
    the proxy forward incoming connections, and there is no attempt to proxy UDP.

    Allow broadcast packets to be sent directly instead of via the MST.
    
    When the "Broadcast = direct" option is used, broadcast packets are not sent
    and forwarded via the Minimum Spanning Tree to all nodes, but are sent directly
    to all nodes that can be reached in one hop.
    
    One use for this is to allow running ad-hoc routing protocols, such as OLSR, on
    top of tinc.

    Allow environment variables to be used for Name.
    
    When the Name starts with a $, the rest will be interpreted as the name of an
    environment variable containing the real Name. When Name is $HOST, but this
    environment variable does not exist, gethostname() will be used to set the
    Name. In both cases, illegal characters will be converted to underscores.

    Add support for systemd style socket activation.
    
    If the LISTEN_FDS environment variable is set and tinc is run in the
    foreground, tinc will use filedescriptors 3 to 3 + LISTEN_FDS for its listening
    TCP sockets. For now, tinc will create matching listening UDP sockets itself.
    
    There is no dependency on systemd or on libsystemd-daemon.

    Add support for multicast communication with UML/QEMU/KVM.
    
    DeviceType = multicast allows one to specify a multicast address and port with
    a Device statement. Tinc will then read/send packets to that multicast group
    instead of to a tun/tap device. This allows interaction with UML, QEMU and KVM
    instances that are listening on the same group.

    Always try next Address when an outgoing connection fails to authenticate.
    
    When making outgoing connections, tinc goes through the list of Addresses and
    tries all of them until one succeeds. However, before it would consider
    establishing a TCP connection a success, even when the authentication failed.
    This would be a problem if the first Address would point to a hostname and port
    combination that belongs to the wrong tinc node, or perhaps even to a non-tinc
    service, causing tinc to endlessly try this Address instead of moving to the
    next one.
    
    Problem found by Delf Eldkraft.

    Make sure disabling old RSA keys works on Windows.
    
    Seeking in files and rewriting parts of them does not seem to work properly on
    Windows. Instead, when old RSA keys are found when generating new ones, the
    file containing the old keys is copied to a temporary file where the changes
    are made, and that file is renamed back to the original filename. On Windows,
    we cannot atomically replace files with a rename(), so we need to move the
    original file out of the way first. If anything fails, the new code will warn
    that the user has to solve the problem by hand.

    The code introduced in commit 41a05f59ba2c3eb5caab555f096ed1b9fbe69ee3 is not
    needed anymore, since tinc has been able to handle UDP packets from a different
    source address than those of the TCP packets since 1.0.10.  When using multiple
    BindToAddress statements, this code does not make sense anymore, we do want the
    kernel to choose the source address on its own.

    Tinc will now, by default, decrement the TTL field of incoming IPv4 and IPv6
    packets, before forwarding them to the virtual network device or to another
    node. Packets with a TTL value of zero will be dropped, and an ICMP Time
    Exceeded message will be sent back.
    
    This behaviour can be disabled using the DecrementTTL option.

    Prevent read_rsa_public_key() from returning an uninitialized RSA structure.
    
    In case the config file could not be opened a new but unitialized RSA structure
    would be returned, causing a segmentation fault later on. This would only
    happen in the case that the config file could be opened before, but not when
    read_rsa_public_key() was called. This situation could occur when the --user
    option was used, and the config files were not readable by the specified user.

    Flush output buffer in send_tcppacket().
    
    This is mainly important for Windows, where the select() call in the
    main thread is not being woken up when the tapreader thread calls
    route(), causing a delay of up to 1 second before the output buffer is
    flushed. This would cause bad performance when UDP communication is not
    possible.

    Make code to detect two nodes with the same Name less triggerhappy.
    
    First of all, if there really are two nodes with the same name, much
    more than 10 contradicting ADD_EDGE and DEL_EDGE messages will be sent.
    Also, we forgot to reset the counters when nothing happened.
    
    In case there is a ADD_EDGE/DEL_EDGE storm, we do not shut down, but
    sleep an increasing amount of time, allowing tinc to recover gracefully
    from temporary failures.

    Instead of UNIX time, the log messages now start with the time in RFC3339
    format, which human-readable and still easy for the computer to parse and sort.
    The HUP signal will also cause the log file to be closed and reopened, which is
    useful when log rotation is used. If there is an error while opening the log
    file, this is logged to stderr.

    Reorder checks for libraries to allow ./configure LDFLAGS=-static.
    
    OpenSSL depends on libdl and libz. When linking dynamically, libcrypto will
    automatically link with the other two libraries.  However, when linking
    statically, these libraries need to be specified explicitly while linking.  By
    moving the autoconf checks for libdl and libz before those for libcrypto, we
    ensure the latter test will be done with the proper libraries.

    Increase threshold for detecting two nodes with the same Name.
    
    In commit 4a21aabada23d1d2c8a10f54dd7248171c4ec82f, code was added to detect
    contradicting ADD_EDGE and DEL_EDGE messages being sent, which is an indication
    of two nodes with the same Name connected to the same VPN.  However, these
    contradictory messages can also happen when there is a network partitioning. In
    the former case a loop happens which causes many contradictory message, while
    in the latter case only a few of those messages will be sent. So, now we
    increase the threshold to at least 10 of both ADD_EDGE and DEL_EDGE messages.

    Do not set indirect flag on edges from nodes with multiple addresses.
    
    Since tinc now handles UDP packets with a different source address and port
    than used for TCP connections, the heuristic to treat edges as indirect when
    tinc could detect that multiple addresses were used does not make sense
    anymore, and can actually reduce performance.

    Prevent anything from updating our own UDP address.
    
    Because we don't want to keep track of that, and this will cause the node
    structure from being relinked into the node tree, which results in myself
    pointing to an invalid address.

    Fix spurious misidentification of incoming UDP packets.
    
    When a UDP packet was received with an unknown source address/port, and if it
    failed a HMAC check against known keys, it could still incorrectly assign that
    UDP address to another node. This would temporarily cause outgoing UDP packets
    to go to the wrong destination address, until packets from the correct address
    were received again.

    Quit when there are too many consecutive errors on the tun/tap device.
    
    Although transient errors sometimes happen on the tun/tap device (for example,
    if the kernel is temporarily out of buffer space), there are situations where
    the tun/tap device becomes permanently broken. Instead of endlessly spamming
    the syslog, we now sleep an increasing amount of time between consecutive read
    errors, and if reads still fail after 10 attempts (approximately 3 seconds),
    tinc will quit.

    With some exceptions, tinc only accepted host configuration options for the
    local node from the corresponding host configuration file. Although this is
    documented, many people expect that they can also put those options in
    tinc.conf. Tinc now internally merges the contents of both tinc.conf and the
    local host configuration file.

    New '-o' option to configure server or hosts from command line
    
    Options given on the command line have precedence over configuration from files.
    
    This can be useful, for example, for a roaming node, for which 'ConnectTo' and
    <host>.Address depends on its location.

    Do not append an address to ANS_KEY messages if we don't know any address.
    
    This would let tinc raise an exception when an ANS_KEY request crossed a
    DEL_EDGE request for the node sending the key.

    literally to other nodes.  However, it is not guaranteed that all nodes have
    the same contents in /etc/services, or have such a file at all.

    Never delete Subnets when StrictSubnets is set
    
    If a node is unreachable, and not connected to an edge anymore, it gets
    deleted. When this happens its subnets are also removed, which should
    not happen with StrictSubnets=yes.
    
    Solution:
    - do not remove subnets in src/net.c::purge(), we know that all subnets
      in the list came from our hosts files.
      I think here you got the check wrong by looking at the tunnelserver
      code below it - with strictsubnets we still inform others but do not
      remove the subnet from our data.
    - do not remove nodes in net.c::purge() that still have subnets
      attached.

    packets for nodes for which we do not have a meta connection with are also dropped.

    device, letting the kernel sort them out).

    reflexive UDP address and port.

    Determine peer's reflexive address and port when exchanging keys.
    
    To help peers that are behind NAT connect to each other directly via UDP, they
    need to know the exact external address and port that they use. Keys exchanged
    between NATted peers necessarily go via a third node, which knows this address
    and port, and can append this information to the keys, which is in turned used
    by the peers.
    
    Since PMTU discovery will immediately trigger UDP communication from both sides
    to each other, this should allow direct communication between peers behind
    full, address-restricted and port-restricted cone NAT.

    When we got a key request for or from a node we don't know, we disconnected the
    node that forwarded us that request.  However, especially in TunnelServer mode,
    disconnecting does not help. We now ignore such requests, but since there is no
    way of telling the original sender that the request was dropped, we now retry
    sending REQ_KEY requests when we don't get an ANS_KEY back.

    this normally does not happen, but in switch mode this is normal.

    One reason to send the ALRM signal is to let tinc immediately try to connect to
    outgoing nodes, for example when PPP or DHCP configuration of the outgoing
    interface finished.  Conversely, when the outgoing interface goes down one can
    now send this signal to let tinc quickly detect that links are down too.

    Do not fragment packets smaller than RFC defined minimum MTUs.
    
    For IPv6, the minimum MTU is 1280 (RFC 2460), for IPv4 the minimum is actually
    68, but this is such a low limit that it will probably hurt performance, so we
    do as if it is 576 (the minimum packet size hosts should be able to handle, RFC
    791). If we detect a path MTU smaller than those minima, and we have to handle
    a packet that is bigger than the PMTU but smaller than those minima, we forward
    them via TCP instead of fragmenting or returning ICMP packets.

    In switch mode, if a known MAC address is claimed by a second node before it
    expired at the first node, it is likely that this is because a computer has
    roamed from the LAN of the first node to that of the second node. To ensure
    packets for that computer are routed to the second node, the first node should
    delete its corresponding Subnet as soon as possible, without waiting for the
    normal expiry timeout.

    Use IP_DONTFRAGMENT instead of IP_MTU_DISCOVER on Windows.
    
    This ensures the DF bit on outgoing UDP packets gets set on Windows when path
    MTU discovery is enabled, reducing fragmentation.

    Forward packets to not directly reachable hosts via UDP if possible.
    
    If MTU probing discovered a node was not reachable via UDP, packets for it were
    forwarded to the next hop, but always via TCP, even if the next hop was
    reachable via UDP. This is now fixed by retrying to send the packet using
    send_packet() if the destination is not the same as the nexthop.

    Fix a possible crash when sending the HUP signal.
    
    When the HUP signal is sent while some outgoing connections have not been made
    yet, or are being retried, a NULL pointer could be dereferenced resulting in
    tinc crashing. We fix this by more careful handling of outgoing_ts, and by
    deleting all connections that have not been fully activated yet at the HUP
    signal is received.

    Use MTU probes to regularly ping other nodes over UDP.
    
    This keeps NAT mappings for UDP alive, and will also detect when a node is not
    reachable via UDP anymore or if the path MTU is decreasing. Tinc will fall back
    to TCP if the node has become unreachable.
    
    If UDP communication is impossible, we stop sending probes, but we retry if it
    changes its keys.
    
    We also decouple the UDP and TCP ping mechanisms completely, to ensure tinc
    properly detects failure of either method.

    The top node was made conditional with the @iftex command, since it should not
    appear in PostScript and PDF output. However, it is still necessary for

    Texi2html also complains about the use of @cindex in the copyright statement,
    so we remove that.

    Although it would be better to have the new defaults, only the most recent

    During the path MTU discovery phase, we might not know the maximum MTU yet, but
    we do know a safe minimum.  If we encounter a packet that is larger than that
    the minimum, we now send it via TCP instead to ensure it arrives.  We also
    allow large packets that we cannot fragment or create ICMP replies for to be
    sent via TCP.

    Use a mutex to allow the TAP reader to process packets faster on Windows.
    
    The TAP-Win32 device is not a socket, and select() under Windows only works
    with sockets.  Tinc used a separate thread to read from the TAP-Win32 device,
    and passed this via a local socket to the main thread which could then select()
    from it. We now use a global mutex, which is only unlocked when the main thread
    is waiting for select(), to allow the TAP reader thread to process packets
    directly.

    Allow compiling for Windows XP and higher.
    
    This allows us to use getaddrinfo(), getnameinfo() and related functions, which
    allow tinc to make connections over existing IPv6 networks. These functions are
    not available on Windows 2000 however. By default, support is enabled, but when
    compiling for Windows 2000 the configure switch --with-windows2000 should be
    used.
    
    Since getaddrinfo() et al. are not functions but macros on Windows, we have to
    use AC_CHECK_DECLS() instead of AC_CHECK_FUNCS() in configure.in.

    Apparently it's impolite to ask GCC to subtract two pointers.
    
    If two pointers do not belong to the same array, pointer subtraction gives
    nonsensical results, depending on the level of optimisation and the
    architecture one is compiling for. It is apparently not just subtracting the
    pointer values and dividing by the size of the object, but uses some kind of
    higher magic not intended for mere mortals. GCC will not warn about this at
    all. Casting to void * is also a no-no, because then GCC does warn that strict
    aliasing rules are being broken. The only safe way to query the ordering of two
    pointers is to use the (in)equality operators.
    
    The unsafe implementation of connection_compare() has probably caused the "old
    connection_t for ... still lingering" messages. Our implementation of AVL trees
    is augmented with a doubly linked list, which is normally what is traversed.
    Only when deleting an old connection the tree itself is traversed.

    This is a slightly modified patch from Grzegorz Dymarek that allows tinc to use
    the tunemu device, which allows tinc to be compiled for iPhones and recent
    iPods. To enable support for tunemu, the --enable-tunemu option has to be used
    when running the configure script.

    Always remove a node from the UDP tree before freeing it.
    
    Valgrind caught tinc reading free'd memory during a purge(). This was caused by
    first removing it from the main node tree, which will already call free_node(),
    and then removing it from the UDP tree. This might cause spurious segmentation
    faults.

    If there is an outstanding MTU probe event for a node which is not reachable
    anymore, a UDP packet would be sent to that node, which caused a key request to
    be sent to that node, which triggered a NULL pointer dereference. Probes and
    other UDP packets to unreachable nodes are now dropped.

    looks cleaner, easier and it is actually safe because
    we still don't talk with the remote nodes there, only
    initiating outgoing connections.

    src/net_socket.c: Bind outgoing TCP sockets to `BindToAddress'.
    
    If a host has multiple addresses on an interface, the source address of the TCP
    connection(s) was picked by the operating system while the UDP packets used a
    bound socket, i. e. the source address was the address specified by the user.
    This caused problems because the receiving code requires the TCP connection and
    the UDP connection to originate from the same IP address.
    
    This patch adds support for the `BindToInterface' and `BindToAddress' options
    to the setup of outgoing TCP connections.
    
    Tested with Debian Etch on x86 and Debian Lenny on x86_64.

    Do not forward broadcast packets when TunnelServer is enabled.
    
    First of all, the idea behind the TunnelServer option is to hide all other
    nodes from each other, so we shouldn't forward broadcast packets from them
    anyway. The other reason is that since edges from other nodes are ignored, the
    calculated minimum spanning tree might not be correct, which can result in
    routing loops.

    Use packet size before decompression to calculate path MTU.
    
    Since compression can either grow or shrink a packet, the size of an MTU probe
    after decompression might not reflect the real path MTU. Now we use the size
    before decompression, which is independent of the compression algorithm, and
    substract a safety margin such that the calculated path MTU will be safe even
    for packets which grow as much as possible after compression.

    ignore indirect edge registrations in tunnelserver mode
    
    In tunnelserver mode we're not interested to hear about
    our client edges, just like in case of subnets.  Just
    ignore all requests which are not about our node or the
    client node.
    
    The fix is very similar to what was done for subnets.
    
    Note that we don't need to add the "unknown" nodes to
    the list in tunnelserver mode too, so move allocation
    of new nodes down the line.

    TunnelServer: Don't disconnect client on DEL_SUBNET too
    
    Similar changes as was in 2327d3f6eb5982bcc922ff1ab1ec436ba6aeffdc
    but for del_subnet_h().
    
    Before, we vere returning false (and causing disconnect of the
    client) in case of tunnelserver and the client sending DEL_SUBNET
    for non-his subnet or for subnet which owner isn't in our connection
    list.
    
    After the mentioned change to add_subnet_h() that routine does not
    add such indirect owners to the connection list anymore, so that
    was ok (owner == NULL and we return true).
    
    But if we too has a connection with the node about which the client
    is sending DEL_SUBNET notification, say, because that client lost
    connection with that other node, we'll disconnect this client from
    us too, returning false for indirect DEL_SUBNET.
    
    Fix that by allowing and ignoring indirect DEL_SUBNET in tunnelserver
    mode.
    
    Also rearranged the function a bit, to match add_subnet_h() (in
    particular, syntax-check everything first, see if we've seen this
    request before).
    
    And also fix some comments.

    Handle UDP packets from different and ports than advertised.
    
    Previously, tinc used a fixed address and port for each node for UDP packet
    exchange.  The port was the one advertised by that node as its listening port.
    However, due to NAT the port might be different.  Now, tinc sends a different
    session key to each node. This way, the sending node can be determined from
    incoming packets by checking the MAC against all session keys. If a match is
    found, the address and port for that node are updated.

    Disable PMTUDiscovery in switch and hub modes.
    
    In switch and hub modes, tinc does not generate ICMP packets in response to
    packets that are larger than the path MTU.  However, if PMTUDiscovery is
    enabled, the IP_MTU_DISCOVER and IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER option is set on the UDP
    sockets, which causes all UDP packets to be sent with the DF bit set, causing
    large packets to be dropped, even if they would otherwise be routed fine.

    Allow weight to be assigned to Subnets.
    
    Tinc allows multiple nodes to own the same Subnet, but did not have a sensible
    way to decide which one to send packets to. Tinc also did not check the
    reachability of nodes when deciding where to route packets to, so it would not
    automatically fail over to a reachable node.
    
    Tinc now assigns a weight to each Subnet. The default weight is 10, with lower
    weights having higher priority.  The Subnets are now internally sorted in the
    same way as the kernel's routing table, and the Subnets are search linearly,
    skipping those of unreachable nodes. A small cache of recently used addresses
    is used to speed up the lookup functions.

    Enable PMTUDiscovery only if BOTH sides wants it.
    
    Don't enable PMTUDiscovery if at least one side does not support it.
    Before it was enabled if at least one side supported it, now both are required.

    Handle neighbor solicitation requests without link layer addresses.
    
    Apparently FreeBSD likes to send out neighbor solicitation requests, even on a
    tun interface where this is completely pointless. These requests do not have an
    option header containing a link layer address, so the proxy-neighborsol code
    was treating these requests as invalid. We now handle such requests, and send
    back equally pointless replies, also without a link layer address. This seems
    to satisfy FreeBSD.

    Allow tunnelserver to work with clients that have other peers.
    
    In TunnelServer mode, tinc server disconnects any client if it announces
    indirect subnets -- subnets that are not theirs (e.g. subnets for nodes
    the CLIENT has connections now, even if those nodes are known to the server
    too).  Fix that by ignoring such (indirect) announces instead.
    
    While we're at it, move check for such indirect subnet registration to
    before allocating new node structure, as in TunnelServer mode we don't
    really need to know that other node.

    Disable old RSA keys when generating new ones.
    
    When generating an RSA keypair, the new public and private keys are appended to
    files. However, when OpenSSL reads keys it only reads the first in a file, not
    the last. Instead of printing an easily ignored warning, tinc now disables old
    keys when appending new ones.

    Use a global list to track outgoing connections.
    
    Previously an outgoing_t was maintained for each outgoing connection,
    but the pointer to it was either stored in a connection_t or in an event_t.
    This made it very hard to keep track of and to clean up.
    
    Now a list is created when tinc starts and reads all the ConnectTo variables,
    and which is recreated when tinc receives a HUP signal.

    Change flush_events() to expire_events().
    
    The former function made a totally bogus shallow copy of the event_tree, called
    the handler of each event and then deleted the whole tree.  This should've
    caused tinc to crash when an ALARM signal was sent more than once, but for some
    reason it didn't. It also behaved incorrectly when a handler added a new event.
    
    The new function just moves the expiration time of all events to the past.

    Only send packets via UDP if UDP communication is possible.
    
    When no session key is known for a node, or when it is doing PMTU discovery but
    no MTU probes have returned yet, packets are sent via TCP. Some logic is added
    to make sure intermediate nodes continue forwarding via TCP.  The per-node
    packet queue is now no longer necessary and has been removed.

    Use a ringbuffer in shared memory to transfer packets from the tapreader thread to the main thread.
    It's a wonder it ever worked before. The socket that is created is not of a
    datagram type, therefore packet boundaries were not preserved, which becomes
    a problem as soon as the TAP-Win32 device receives packets in fast succession.

      the public key to the host configuration file (otherwise rsa_key.pub).

    - Fix subnet_lookup()
    - Reorder some syslog messages to make more sense

    - Open UDP connection for all known hosts. Comments please.

commit f95cc86d0c14ca4c47e5459af4bb6d1170baa9f5
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 7 21:43:28 2000 +0000

    Changed execution of tinc-up:
    - Do not free() strings that have been putenv()d, see man page of the
      latter.
    - Do not set IFNAME anymore, it appears that the ioctl to get the name of
      the interface does not work at all. Since it is set to NETNAME in case
      of tun/tap and it is known beforehand in case of ethertap, there is no
      need for it anyway... (though it would've simplified things).

    (Quoting Laurence Lane:)
    
    The prefix is correctly set for /usr, but is
    overridden with the current make install. DESTDIR is the clean way to
    relocate the installation into the debian/tmp build dir.

    Initial revision. Lots of loose ends, not usable yet.

commit c5737583c8a5d099a71174e1eb997e0972ae03e9
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 30 12:41:06 2000 +0000

    - Instead of logging an error when remote end closes the connection,
      we print a nice message if appropiate debug level is set.
    - If we get ADD_HOSTs or DEL_HOSTs for ourself, then connection lists
      are really messed up. We restart, and hope our problems go away.

commit 24874d0806bac5d75663ea9de67a71171bfc97b6
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 30 11:45:16 2000 +0000

      for MAXTIMEOUT seconds, and then restart tinc

Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 29 17:09:08 2000 +0000

    - New semantics for BASIC_INFO, ADD_HOST and DEL_HOST requests. This will
      improve connection list consistency, ensures the tree property, and
      allows for recovery from situations where track of connections is lost.

commit e8e7379311ca3bf6e1fdd7d0f477a43e510e2317
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 29 13:04:15 2000 +0000

    - Removed all IP_ADDR_S macros, because gettext doesn't like them. Each
      connection now has two hostnames: real_hostname (replacing the old),
      and vpn_hostname. In those places where hostnames really aren't usefull
      IP_ADDR_S has been replaced by %d.%d.%d.%d.

Date:   Tue Jun 27 12:58:04 2000 +0000

Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sun Jun 25 15:16:12 2000 +0000

    Large cleanup:
    - Removed hostname lookup (it blocks, and you can always do it yourself)
    - Reorganized debug levels (after hints from Axel M�ller):
      0	Startup message and errors
      1	Connection logging
      2	Meta protocol information
      3	Verbose meta protocol (includes copy of transmitted requests)
      4	Packet information (logs transmission/errors of UDP packets)
      5	Verbose packet information (every single byte, not implemented yet
    	to protect ourselves from filling up /var/log directories)

commit d8e2f7104c3203edbf23d2349656c765a4310dee
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 19:27:03 2000 +0000

    First step for implementation of the "indirectdata" directive. This should
    allow _leaf_ tincds to be behind firewalls.
    The protocol has changed and is INCOMPATIBLE with previous versions. The
    PROT_CURRENT value has been incremented.

    Internationalization of tinc.

commit 61e71ab74ad9b5edb044b84ccf1111a33eb468cb
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sat May 27 20:23:01 2000 +0000

    Terminate a connection on any error. Furthermore, disallow del_host,
    add_host and other important requests until remote host has properly
    authenticated itself.

commit cc01b18bc6d0bfb12e6770fc0a007c278f355d9e
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sat May 27 19:44:04 2000 +0000

    Made tinc persistent. If no outgoing connection can be established right
    after the start of the daemon, it won't quit anymore but will retry in 5
    minutes. Also, 5 minutes is now the maximum time to wait for a retry.

commit 028659bfbf164cb7a72831506896e291010b251f
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sat May 27 19:23:20 2000 +0000

    Fixed typos. When terminating a connection, it's status is not only set to
    remove=1 but also active=0.

commit e4ff969a9868ecc25a85daab620f97227de8d493
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sat May 27 19:04:12 2000 +0000

    Fix for a DoS attack:
     A remote user could telnet to the tinc daemon and type only this line:
     61 6 00000000/00000000:28f
     This would deny any packets to be sent to other tinc networks (except
     for to the hosts that run tincd's themselves). Solution is to skip
     hosts in lookup_conn() that have not been activated yet.
    Fixed potential conn_list table corruption:
     If a new connection is accepted but a connection with the same subnet
     would already exist in the connection list, the OLD connection is
     terminated.

commit 4d71de15e8abd137702a5dc04a743d246c3f1110
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sat May 27 13:21:20 2000 +0000

    Documentation updates. Removed all references to configuration variable
    "AllowConnect", since it is NOT used in tinc. Added information about
    "VpnMask". Elaborated a bit about "private" and "virtual" networks.

commit 85e3c1f2716c622ca8cada83d833703bf8a3ecc6
Author: Ivo Timmermans <ivo@lychnis.net>
Date:   Fri May 26 11:25:59 2000 +0000

    Updated by Lubomir Bulej and Mads Kiilerich: it uses /etc/tinc/nets.boot and the VpnMask directive in the config files.

Author: Ivo Timmermans <ivo@lychnis.net>
Date:   Sun May 21 23:01:28 2000 +0000

Author: Ivo Timmermans <ivo@lychnis.net>
Date:   Sun May 21 22:40:41 2000 +0000

Author: Ivo Timmermans <ivo@lychnis.net>
Date:   Sun May 21 22:27:31 2000 +0000

    When VpnMask is not present in the config file, silently use $MSK as vpnmask.

commit 73b3e7ce03cacb644a8101610933b221fdf432d6
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sun May 21 22:21:38 2000 +0000

    Fixed last typo. Init.d now uses ifconfig command to set both the tap's IP
    address as well as the correct route. Furthermore, if no VpnMask is given,
    a default of 255.255.0.0 is chosen and a warning issued.

commit e20e143f1e99bdc0a7d92e97da1bd0dc40e8a83b
Author: Guus Sliepen <guus@tinc-vpn.org>
Date:   Sun May 14 13:02:20 2000 +0000

    Changed ping behaviour (backwards compatible). If we don't have any data
    to send, we don't need to check if the connection is still alive.
    Furthermore, if we receive any kind of data from the other end, we know
    it's alive, so we don't need to check it either. So, PING requests are
    only sent if we send packets but there is no response.

Date:   Mon May 1 18:07:12 2000 +0000

    Meta protocol overhaul. Tinc is now incompatible with previous versions,
    furthermore this version does NOT work yet because of a problem with
    sending keys (these should be converted to base36 or something like that).
    It is possible to telnet to the tinc daemon now and type some commands
    by hand though :).
