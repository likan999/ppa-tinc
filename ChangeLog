Version 1.0pre2                                              May 31 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ivo Timmermans (56):
      Deleted the protocol description.
      Perl version of the system startup script.
      Only print an error with send_termreq if debug_lvl is 2 or more.
      Add check for mpz_powm in libgmp3.
      Version 1.0pre1-0.1.
      Changed version to 1.0pre2.
      Give IP address instead of hex number when connecting tcp socket failed.
      Add shlibs control file for the blowfish library.
      Inserted useful content.
      Add initscript, tincd->tinc.
      Add description, better dependancies.
      Mention both upstream authors.
      tincd->tinc
      .deb version number 1.0pre2-0.4.
      Updated to newer version.
      Exit with zero status if  is empty.
      Unlimited length in the config file, thanks to Cris van Pelt.
      Depend on perl5.
      *** empty log message ***
      Look if the tap devices exist before bluntly remaking them.
      Use the new VpnMask directive to add a route to the rest of the VPN.
      This file is generated with dpkg-buildpackage.
      Read /etc/tinc/nets.boot to find the networks that have to be started.
      Create a default /etc/tinc/nets.boot after installation, containing all directories under /etc/tinc by default.
      Version 1.0pre2-0.3
      Don't distribute the file files.
      Find networks in  instead of .
      Include postinst in the distribution.
      Errors will not terminate the script or result in a nonzero exit code.
      Updated copyright notice.
      Fixed typo.
      Mask the vpn net with the vpn netmask, route would give an error if the netmask didn't match the net.
      When VpnMask is not present in the config file, silently use $MSK as vpnmask.
      Add an example of using VpnMask.
      Use /etc/tinc/example as a base directory for an example.  /etc/tinc/example/README points to /usr/share/doc/tinc/README.Debian.
      Create an empty /etc/tinc/nets.boot.
      Updated by Lubomir Bulej and Mads Kiilerich: it uses /etc/tinc/nets.boot and the VpnMask directive in the config files.
      Internationalization of tinc.
      Include intl/ directory in the list of subdirs.
      Include system.h and ABOUT-NLS.
      Update acconfig.h to include values for gettext inclusion.
      Include GNU gettext checks.
      Define LOCALEDIR in CFLAGS.
      Dutch translation of tinc.
      Bounds check for request id (between 0 and 255).
      Updated changes list for version 1.0pre2.
      Added new configuration directive `Hostnames', which controls the resolving of IP addresses to hostnames.
      When a connection is terminated, all hosts that are still connected get notified of the lost connections.
      In terminate_connection, only send a notification to hosts that are directly connected to us.  (DEL_HOST gets forwarded automatically.)
      Only accept an ADD_HOST request for a host that already exists in our conn_list if the nexthop field matches the sender.  This is a workaround for older clients.
      Include news for 1.0pre2.
      Tell about /etc/tinc/nets.boot.
      Updated Dutch translation.
      Version 1.0pre2-1.
      Handle locale settings.
      Miscellaneous copyright updates.

      Added `deb' target.
      Filled up the protocol structs with unused bytes.
      Got rid of the nasty hacks... and replaced it by another one.
      Initially, the vpn_mask of a connection is 255.255.255.255 to avoid confusion with lookup_conn.
      Replaced check for status.active by status.dataopen in check_network_activity.
      New way of handling the meta protocol.
      Read public keys the right way (tm).
      Removed debug messages.
      Read one less byte from an ANS_KEY request.
      Send one less byte from an ANS_KEY request.
      Protocol fix (ANS_KEY).  This breaks 0.3.3 protocol compatibility.

      Added checkpoints to beginning and ending of every function.
      Packet queues fixed. They caused the trouble when resending keys.
      Fixed typo and removed some unnecessary variables.
