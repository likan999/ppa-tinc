version 1.0.5                Nov 14 2006

 * Lots of small fixes.

 * Broadcast packets no longer grow in size with each hop. This should
   fix switch mode (again).
 
 * Generic host-up and host-down scripts.

 * Optionally dump graph in graphviz format to a file or a script.

 * Support LZO 2.0 and later.

version 1.0.4                May  4 2005

 * Fix switch and hub modes.

 * Optionally start scripts when a Subnet becomes (un)reachable.

version 1.0.3                Nov 11 2004

* Show error message when failing to write a PID file.

* Ignore spaces at end of lines in config files.

* Fix handling of late packets.

* Unify BSD tun/tap device handling. This allows IPv6 on tun devices and
  anything on tap devices as long as the underlying OS supports it.

* Handle IPv6 on Solaris tun devices.

* Allow tinc to work properly under Windows XP SP2.

* Allow VLAN tagged Ethernet frames in switch and hub mode.

* Experimental PMTUDiscovery, TunnelServer and BlockingTCP options.

version 1.0.2                Nov  8 2003

* Fix address and hostname resolving under Windows.

* Remove warnings about non-existing scripts and unsupported address families.

* Use the event logger under Windows.

* Fix quoting of filenames and command line arguments under Windows.

* Strict checks for length incoming network packets and return values of
  cryptographic functions,

* Fix a bug in metadata handling that made the tinc daemon abort.

version 1.0.1                Aug 14 2003

* Allow empty lines in config files.

* Fix handling of spaces and backslashes in filenames under native Windows.

* Allow scripts to be executed under native Windows.

* Update documentation, make it less Linux specific.

version 1.0                  Aug  4 2003

* Lots of small bugfixes and code cleanups.

* Throughput doubled and latency reduced.

* Added support for LZO compression.

* No need to set MAC address or disable ARP anymore.

* Added support for Windows 2000 and XP, both natively and in a Cygwin
  environment.

version 1.0pre8              Sep 16 2002

* More fixes for subnets with prefixlength undivisible by 8.

* Added support for NetBSD and MacOS/X.

* Switched from undirected graphs to directed graphs to avoid certain race
  conditions and improve scalability.

* Generalized broadcasting and forwarding of protocol messages.

* Cleanup of source code.


version 1.0pre7              Apr  7 2002

* Don't do blocking read()s when getting a signal.

* Remove RSA key checking code, since it sometimes thinks perfectly good RSA
  keys are bad.

* Fix handling of subnets when prefixlength isn't divisible by 8.


version 1.0pre6              Mar 27 2002

* Improvement of redundant links:

  * Non-blocking connects.
  
  * Protocol broadcast messages can no longer go into an infinite loop.
  
  * Graph algorithm updated to look harder for direct connections.

* Good support for routing IPv6 packets over the VPN. Works on Linux,
  FreeBSD, possibly OpenBSD but not on Solaris.

* Support for tunnels over IPv6 networks. Works on all supported
  operating systems.

* Optional compression of UDP connections using zlib.

* Optionally let UDP connections inherit TOS field of tunneled packets.

* Optionally start scripts when certain hosts become (un)reachable.


version 1.0pre5              Feb  9 2002

* Security enhancements:

  * Added sequence number and optional message authentication code to
    the packets.

  * Configurable encryption cipher and digest algorithms.

* More robust handling of dis- and reconnects.

* Added a "switch" and a "hub" mode to allow bridging setups.

* Preliminary support for routing of IPv6 packets.

* Supports Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.


It looks like this might be the last release before 1.0.


version 1.0pre4              Jan 17 2001

* Updated documentation; the documentation now reflects the
  configuration as it is.

* Some internal changes to make tinc scale better for large
  networks, such as using AVL trees instead of linked lists for the
  connection list.  

* RSA keys can be stored in separate files if needed.  See the
  documentation for more information.

* tinc has now been reported to run on Linux PowerPC and FreeBSD x86.



version 1.0pre3              Oct 31 2000

* The protocol has been redesigned, and although some details are
  still under discussion, this is secure.  Care has been taken to
  resist most, if not all, attacks.
  
* Unfortunately this protocol is not compatible with earlier versions,
  nor are earlier versions compatible with this version.  Because the
  older protocol has huge security flaws, we feel that not
  implementing backwards compatibility is justified.

* Some data about the protocol:

  * It uses public/private RSA keys for authentication (this is the
    actual fix for the security hole).

  * All cryptographic functions have been taken out of tinc, instead
    it uses the OpenSSL library functions.

  * Offers support for multiple subnets per tinc daemon.

* New is also the support for the universal tun/tap device.  This
  means better portability to FreeBSD and Solaris.

* tinc is tested to compile on Solaris, Linux x86, Linux alpha.

* tinc now uses the OpenSSL library for cryptographic operations.
  More information on getting and installing OpenSSL is in the manual.
  This also means that the GMP library is no longer required.

* Further, thanks to Enrique Zanardi, we have Spanish messages; Matias
  Carrasco provided us with a Spanish translation of the manual.


What still needs to be done before 1.0:

* Documentation.  Especially since the protocol has changed, and a lot
  of configuration directives have been added.




version 1.0pre2              May 31 2000

* This version has been internationalized; and a Dutch translation has          
  been included.                                                                
                                                                                
* Two configuration variables have been added:                                  
  * VpnMask - the IP network mask for the entire VPN, not just our              
    subnet (as given by MyVirtualIP).  The Redhat and Debian packages           
    use this variable in their system startup scripts, but it is                
    ignored by tinc.                                                            
  * Hostnames - if set to `yes', look up the names of IP addresses              
    trying to connect to us.  Default set to `no', to prevent lockups           
    during lookups.                                                             
                                                                                
* The system startup scripts for Debian and Redhat use                          
  /etc/tinc/nets.boot to find out which networks need to be started             
  during system boot.                                                           
                                                                                
* Fixes to prevent denial of service attacks by sending random data             
  after connecting (and even when the connection has been established),         
  either random garbage or just nonsensical protocol fields.                    
                                                                                
* tinc will retry to connect upon startup, does not quit if it doesn't          
  work the first time.                                                          
                                                                                
* Hosts that are disconnected implicitly if we lose a connection get            
  deleted from the internal list, to prevent hogging eachother with             
  add and delete requests when the connection is restored.                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
What still needs to be done before 1.0:                                         
                                                                                
* Documentation.                                                                
* Failover ConnectTo lines, try another one if the first doesn't work.
