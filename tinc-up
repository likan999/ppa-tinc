# This file sets up the tap device.
# It gives you the freedom to do anything you want with it.
# Use the correct name for the tap device:
# For ethertap this is tap0, tap1, tap2 etcetera,
# but for the universal tun/tap device use $NETNAME.

# Set hardware ethernet address (required for Mode=router)
ifconfig tap0 hw ether fe:fd:0:0:0:0

# Give it the right ip and netmask. Remember, the subnet of the
# tap device must be larger than that of the individual Subnets
# as defined in the host configuration file!
